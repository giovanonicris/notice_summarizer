Regulatory Notice 25-04,Dustin Hite  Comment On Regulatory Notice 25-04,2025-03-17,"FINRA’s rules should be modernized to address economic costs, evolving markets, technology advancements, and regulatory inefficiencies. Below are key areas for modernization, including specific rules, guidance updates, and regulatory overlaps that warrant attention.
1. Focus Areas for Modernizing FINRA Rules
Several FINRA rules are outdated, overly burdensome, or fail to account for modern trading environments and technologies.
A. Short Selling & Market Transparency Rules
Rule 4320 – Short Sales in OTC Equity Securities
This rule should be revised to increase reporting requirements for OTC short positions and provide real-time data transparency to prevent market manipulation (e.g., MMTLP scenario).
Expand close-out requirements under Regulation SHO (Rule 204) to eliminate extended failures to deliver (FTDs).
Rule 4560 – Short Interest Reporting
Require daily reporting (instead of semi-monthly) for more transparency on short interest levels.
Mandate reporting of total synthetic shares created through swaps or derivatives.
B. Market Halt & Trading Suspension Rules
Rule 6440 – Trading and Quotation Halt in OTC Equity Securities
FINRA should reform U3 halt procedures to prevent unjustified suspensions (e.g., MMTLP).
Introduce a formal appeals process so investors can challenge trading halts.
Rule 11892 – Clearly Erroneous Transactions
Update criteria for trade cancellations to prevent market makers from abusing “erroneous” cancellations to avoid fulfilling transactions that move against them.
C. Market Making & Order Handling
Rule 5210 – Marking of Customer Orders
Require brokers to identify and report synthetic share orders created through market maker internalization.
Rule 5320 – Prohibition Against Trading Ahead of Customer Orders
Strengthen enforcement to prevent brokers from routing orders through dark pools before executing retail trades.
2. FINRA Interpretations & Guidance Needing Updates
FINRA should modernize guidance in several areas where regulatory gaps, risks, and inefficiencies exist.
A. Naked Shorting & Failures to Deliver (FTDs)
FINRA should clarify guidance on how synthetic shorts and FTDs are addressed under Regulation SHO.
Provide more frequent public disclosures of FTD data, including off-exchange (dark pool) failures.
B. Alternative Trading Systems (ATS) & Dark Pools
FINRA should enhance transparency requirements for dark pool order routing, ensuring brokers prioritize best execution for retail orders rather than internalizing trades.
C. Special Purpose Acquisition Companies (SPACs)
Guidance should clarify how retail investors in SPACs are protected from dilution, insider trading, and hidden fees.
D. Crypto & Digital Asset Regulations
Clarify whether crypto trading platforms require broker-dealer registration.
Establish rules on custody and liquidity requirements for digital assets.
3. FINRA Rules That Should Be Modernized to Support Innovation
To encourage innovation and modern technology, FINRA should focus on removing unnecessary barriers while ensuring investor protection.
A. Streamlining Broker-Dealer Registration for Fintech Startups
Rule 1014 – Membership Application Process
Simplify the registration process for fintech startups while maintaining oversight.
Implement a sandbox model where innovative firms can test new services under controlled conditions.
B. Blockchain & Distributed Ledger Technology
Provide clearer guidance on how broker-dealers can use blockchain for clearing, settlement, and recordkeeping.
Update Regulatory Notice 21-25 on digital assets to provide more flexibility for using blockchain in securities markets.
C. AI & Automated Trading Compliance
Introduce modernized compliance rules for AI-based order execution and risk management.
Provide guidance on how AI-driven trading models comply with best execution rules.
4. Addressing Gaps, Risks, and Other Challenges in Market Regulation
As markets, products, services, and technology evolve, new risks and regulatory gaps emerge that FINRA should address to better protect investors while maintaining market integrity. Below are four key areas where additional guidance or standards are needed to close regulatory loopholes and modernize oversight.
A. Enhancing Market Manipulation Detection & Enforcement
Market manipulation tactics, including naked short selling, spoofing, layering, and abusive algorithmic trading, have outpaced existing regulatory enforcement mechanisms. Key regulatory gaps that FINRA should address include:
Increased transparency of synthetic short positions and derivatives-based manipulation.
Require real-time disclosure of synthetic shares, swaps, and total market exposure to short positions.
Enhance Regulation SHO (Rule 204) compliance to ensure timely close-outs of short positions.
Better tracking of Failures to Deliver (FTDs) and off-exchange trades.
Increase reporting frequency for FTDs and short interest from bi-monthly to daily.
Mandate broker-dealers to report all FTDs linked to derivatives and swaps.
Tightening loopholes that allow manipulation through dark pools and internalization.
FINRA should require public disclosure of off-exchange (dark pool) trading volume in real-time.
Prevent market makers from routing retail trades into internalized liquidity pools before public exchanges.
B. Hybrid Market Structures (Crypto + Traditional Assets) & Digital Asset Regulations
With the increasing intersection of traditional finance (TradFi) and decentralized finance (DeFi), FINRA should provide clearer rules on how broker-dealers can handle crypto-related securities and hybrid financial products. Key areas of concern:
Defining whether crypto trading platforms need to register as broker-dealers.
FINRA should clarify which crypto assets fall under its jurisdiction and which require SEC or CFTC oversight.
Provide guidelines on custody and liquidity requirements for digital assets.
Establishing risk management standards for broker-dealers engaging with crypto markets.
Introduce clear rules on margin, leverage, and collateral requirements for crypto-backed securities.
Require disclosure of crypto exposure in regulatory filings.
Regulating tokenized securities and blockchain-based settlement systems.
Provide guidance on how tokenized securities can be traded within existing regulatory frameworks.
Address clearing and settlement issues for blockchain-based transactions.
C. Investor Protections in Emerging Financial Products (SPACs, Options, OTC, ETFs, etc.)
New investment products, including SPACs (Special Purpose Acquisition Companies), leveraged ETFs, and complex derivatives, pose risks that FINRA should address to prevent investor harm. Areas needing modernization:
SPAC Regulations & Retail Investor Protections
Increase transparency of fees, dilution risks, and sponsor incentives in SPAC filings.
Prevent misleading marketing of SPACs that suggests they are “safe” investments.
Option Trading & Margin Regulation for Retail Investors
Review option approval processes to ensure retail traders understand risks before engaging in complex strategies.
Require brokers to provide real-time risk analysis for margin accounts to prevent unexpected liquidations.
OTC Market Transparency & Pump-and-Dump Prevention
Strengthen oversight of penny stock promotions and misinformation campaigns.
Mandate better disclosure requirements for OTC-listed companies to reduce fraud.
D. Strengthening Surveillance of Trading Halts & Market-Wide Circuit Breakers
The lack of clear rules and transparency in trading halts, particularly in OTC and small-cap securities, has led to market disruptions and loss of investor confidence (e.g., MMTLP’s U3 halt). Areas requiring reform:
Trading Halts (U3 Halt Rules & OTC Suspensions)
Introduce a formal appeals process for investors affected by unjustified halts.
Require brokers to notify investors of pending halts with sufficient time to act.
Circuit Breakers & Liquidity Controls for Volatile Stocks
Adapt market-wide circuit breakers to better handle high-volatility securities.
Implement liquidity rules that ensure order execution priority for retail investors during extreme price swings.
Conclusion
By addressing these regulatory gaps and risks, FINRA can create a more transparent, fair, and efficient market structure. The focus should be on:
✅ Closing loopholes that enable market manipulation through short selling and dark pools.
✅ Providing clarity on crypto and digital asset regulations to align with modern finance.
✅ Enhancing investor protections for SPACs, options, and OTC securities to prevent fraud and financial harm.
✅ Reforming trading halt rules to ensure market integrity and prevent unjustified suspensions.
FINRA must take a proactive approach to market modernization to ensure that regulatory frameworks evolve alongside financial markets and technology while prioritizing investor protection and market stability.

Regulatory Notice 25-04,Fredrick Scuteri Comment On Regulatory Notice 25-04,2025-03-18,"I am writing to respectfully request your attention to an issue I have encountered regarding the process for obtaining a waiver for individuals like myself who have held multiple FINRA licenses in the past but whose registrations have expired due to factors outside of their control.
I have held several FINRA licenses dating back to 1998 (please refer to the attached report for details). In 2013, I transitioned from the sell side to the buy side, accepting a position at a FINRA-registered investment manager. Although I had the relevant experience, I was told by the compliance officer that I was ineligible to be registered with the firm because my role was in operations/treasury, which they deemed unrelated to the job functions requiring registration. As a result, my licenses expired in late 2015.
Fast forward to 2021, when I returned to the sell side at a member broker-dealer as its Chief Operating Officer. At that time, the compliance officer submitted a formal request for a waiver to reinstate my Series 7, 66, 55,9 & 10 licenses. However, I was informed that FINRA allegedly declined the waiver request with no specific reason given.
Now, at 52 years old, with 30 years of experience—almost all of it within registered firms—I am left in a difficult position: none of my previous registrations are active, and I find myself unable to utilize the full scope of my professional experience because of regulatory hurdles. I believe that this situation is a clear example of how the waiver process could be more accommodating to experienced professionals like myself who are unable to retake exams that we passed decades ago.
I understand the importance of regulatory requirements, but I also believe that individuals who have built long careers in the industry should not be penalized for circumstances that are beyond their control. I am respectfully requesting that FINRA consider revising the waiver process to make it more accessible to professionals with a proven track record, allowing them to continue contributing to the industry without the need to re-take exams that may no longer reflect their qualifications or expertise.
Thank you for your time and consideration. I would be happy to provide any further details or documentation regarding my case. I look forward to your response and hope we can work together to address this concern in a constructive manner.","I am writing to respectfully request your attention to an issue I have encountered regarding the process for obtaining a waiver for individuals like myself who have held multiple FINRA licenses in the past but whose registrations have expired due to factors outside of their control.

Regulatory Notice 25-04,Thomas Marcone Comment On Regulatory Notice 25-04,2025-03-27,"What specific FINRA rules should be a focus for modernization based on their economic costs and benefits; changes in markets, products, services, or technology; or otherwise? What groups of FINRA requirements should be a focus? Please include FINRA rules that may be mandated or derived from a statutory or other non-FINRA regulatory requirement applicable to FINRA or its members.
Rules 3110, 3120, 3130, 3210, 3270, 3280, 1010, 4590, 1210, 1220, and 1230 should be in focus.
What changes to FINRA’s rules or other requirements applicable to FINRA members would facilitate innovation and the development and deployment of new technologies and services that enable them to better serve markets and investors?
Lessening of barriers of entry. Much innovation comes from technology but today people with coding skills would rather work in tech than sit for Series exams that may not have much to do with their actual jobs. The rules seemed to be based on regulating salespeople more than other types of persons, so it would be a good idea to reassess why we have so many categories of registration.
There should be separate rulesets or clearer guidance how FINRA rules apply to firms with limited businesses.  Another commenter introduced the idea of NCASFs, which seems like an approach that could work. Similarly, now that most proprietary trading firms must be FINRA members, it doesn’t make sense to apply FINRA’s rules that have their roots in customer protection to firms that have no customers.  Many FINRA rules stem from measures to address specific bad behavior, which may or may not still be necessary in light of how business models have changed over time. If the original intent behind a rule is no longer a high concern, we should consider eliminating it. Similarly, FINRA should revisit the U4 process, particularly where the guidance concerning the form doesn’t quite align with FINRA rules. The filing process is quite antiquated and FINPRO seems like it could be the way of the future, but it also seems hamstrung by dependence on the existing way things are done.
Are there gaps, risks or other challenges created by changes in markets, products, services or technology where additional guidance or standards would better enable member firms to serve investors, consistent with investor protection and market integrity?
The rules and guidance should be more clearly organized between what are must do items and ones that are best practices, but not something that is required if it doesn’t make sense for your particular business.  FINRA should also empower its staff to provide more concrete guidance.
Where does FINRA’s oversight of its member firms interact with other non-FINRA regulatory requirements in a manner that should be a focus for modernization, based on unnecessary or duplicative burdens, insufficiently tailored requirements, member firm or investor confusion, or otherwise? For example, what differences between FINRA’s requirements for broker-dealers and the requirements that apply for investment advisers engaging in similar activities should be a focus for modernization?
There should be one exam program instead of one for each SRO. The exchange SROs typically focus on very nuanced requirements of their specific rulebooks. This type of complexity should be reduced. Simply the registration categories and specify more clearly who needs to be registered and why. Same for Associated Persons.
There should be consideration given where a firm is subject to multiple regulators, e.g., SEC, NFA, and CFTC.  It seems reasonable that there should be some overlap and some due should be given where the requirements are similar.  There should be some way of resolving what is reasonable in terms of principles based rules vs. prescriptive rules.    There should be a review process for inquiries to root out overreach and unreasonable requests; too often I have seen requests under the guise of “just gathering information” that are a lot of work to respond to without any apparent connection to anything.","What changes to FINRA’s rules or other requirements applicable to FINRA members would facilitate innovation and the development and deployment of new technologies and services that enable them to better serve markets and investors?

Regulatory Notice 25-04,Chris Comment On Regulatory Notice 25-04,2025-03-28,"1. What specific FINRA rules should be a focus for modernization based on their economic costs and benefits; changes in markets, products, services, or technology; or otherwise? What groups of FINRA requirements should be a focus? Please include FINRA rules that may be mandated or derived from a statutory or other non-FINRA regulatory requirement applicable to FINRA or its members.
FINRA Rule 3210 should be a focal point for modernization, particularly as it pertains to restrictions on associated persons’ spouses (covered spouses) engaging in scalp trading in the futures market. The rule requires prior written consent from the employer member and notification to the executing member for any account in which an associated person has a beneficial interest, including spousal accounts. While designed to prevent conflicts of interest and ensure oversight, this requirement imposes significant economic costs—such as administrative burdens, lost trading opportunities, and compliance overhead—without clear evidence of proportional benefits in the context of futures markets, which are regulated primarily by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) rather than FINRA.
The rapid evolution of markets and technology, including the rise of automated, high-frequency trading platforms, has made scalp trading a common strategy in futures markets. These markets differ from securities markets in terms of products (e.g., futures contracts vs. equities) and regulatory oversight (CFTC vs. SEC/FINRA). Applying Rule 3210 uniformly to futures trading by covered spouses creates an outdated restriction that does not account for these distinctions. Modernization could involve carving out exceptions for futures trading, reducing economic costs for firms and individuals while maintaining adequate safeguards. This rule, though FINRA-specific, interacts with broader statutory requirements under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, which mandates oversight of associated persons, making it a candidate for targeted reform.
2. What areas of FINRA interpretations or guidance regarding existing rules should be a focus for modernization?
FINRA’s interpretations of Rule 3210, particularly around the definition of “beneficial interest” and the scope of spousal accounts, warrant modernization. Current guidance presumes that an associated person has a beneficial interest in a spouse’s account unless proven otherwise, which triggers burdensome notification and consent processes. This presumption is overly broad in the context of scalp trading futures, where the spouse may be an independent trader with no reliance on the associated person’s firm information or resources. Guidance could be updated to clarify that scalp trading in futures by a covered spouse, absent evidence of insider information or firm involvement, does not inherently pose a conflict requiring oversight under Rule 3210. This would align the rule’s application with modern market realities, where retail access to futures trading platforms is widespread and independent of securities firm affiliations.
3. What changes to FINRA’s rules or other requirements applicable to FINRA members would facilitate innovation and the development and deployment of new technologies and services that enable them to better serve markets and investors?
Amending Rule 3210 to exempt or streamline oversight of covered spouses’ scalp trading in futures markets would facilitate innovation by reducing regulatory friction. Modern trading technologies—such as algorithmic platforms and real-time data feeds—enable retail investors, including spouses, to engage in sophisticated strategies like scalping independently. The current rule’s restrictive framework discourages such activity by imposing unnecessary compliance hurdles, potentially stifling the adoption of innovative trading tools by households linked to associated persons. A revised rule could introduce a risk-based approach, allowing firms to focus oversight on activities with demonstrable ties to securities markets or firm operations, thereby freeing resources to develop technology-driven services that enhance investor access and market efficiency.
4. Are there gaps, risks or other challenges created by changes in markets, products, services or technology where additional guidance or standards would better enable member firms to serve investors, consistent with investor protection and market integrity?
A key gap exists in Rule 3210’s failure to differentiate between securities and futures markets, particularly as technological advancements have blurred traditional boundaries. Scalp trading in futures by covered spouses poses minimal risk to securities market integrity, given the CFTC’s robust oversight of futures exchanges and the lack of direct overlap with FINRA-regulated activities. However, without updated guidance, firms face uncertainty about compliance obligations, potentially leading to over-restriction of legitimate trading activity. New standards could address this by establishing clear criteria—e.g., no use of firm resources or material nonpublic information—for exempting futures trading from Rule 3210’s scope. This would mitigate risks of regulatory overreach while ensuring investor protection and market integrity are upheld in relevant contexts.
5. Where does FINRA’s oversight of its member firms interact with other non-FINRA regulatory requirements in a manner that should be a focus for modernization, based on unnecessary or duplicative burdens, insufficiently tailored requirements, member firm or investor confusion, or otherwise? For example, what differences between FINRA’s requirements for broker-dealers and the requirements that apply for investment advisers engaging in similar activities should be a focus for modernization?
Rule 3210’s application to futures trading by covered spouses overlaps with CFTC regulations, creating duplicative burdens. The CFTC already imposes registration, disclosure, and surveillance requirements on futures market participants, rendering FINRA’s additional layer of oversight redundant for activities outside its securities-focused jurisdiction. This overlap causes confusion for member firms, which must navigate conflicting or parallel requirements, and for investors (e.g., spouses) unclear about permissible trading. In contrast, investment advisers under SEC oversight face no equivalent restriction on spousal futures trading unless it involves client assets or conflicts, highlighting an inconsistency in regulatory treatment. Modernization could harmonize FINRA’s approach with CFTC and SEC frameworks, tailoring Rule 3210 to securities-specific risks and reducing unnecessary burdens on futures-related activities.
6. What areas of reporting or data production related to existing rules should be a focus for modernization?
The reporting requirements under Rule 3210—such as duplicate account statements and confirmations sent to employer members for spousal accounts—should be modernized to exclude futures trading unless tied to securities violations. Current data production demands are ill-suited to the high-frequency nature of scalp trading, generating voluminous, often irrelevant records that strain firm resources without enhancing oversight. A modernized approach could leverage technology to implement targeted monitoring (e.g., automated flags for suspicious activity) rather than blanket reporting, aligning data collection with actual risks. This would reduce compliance costs and improve efficiency, allowing firms to focus on protecting investors in areas where FINRA’s authority is most relevant.","While designed to prevent conflicts of interest and ensure oversight, this requirement imposes significant economic costs—such as administrative burdens, lost trading opportunities, and compliance overhead—without clear evidence of proportional benefits in the context of futures markets, which are regulated primarily by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) rather than FINRA.

Regulatory Notice 25-04,DMA Consulting Group Comment On Regulatory Notice 25-04,2025-04-28,"April 24, 2025 

To: 

Financial Industry Regulatory Authority 
via Online Portal 

Ladies and Gentlemen: 

This will be the first of a series of comments by the undersigned in conjunction with FINRA's request 
for comments, as set forth in FINRA Notice 25-04. 

FINRA's focus, concerning the updating and modernization of its rules, is on: 

•  Capital Formation. Key areas where its rules or related regulatory requirements may affect 
or create unnecessary challenges for member firms’ support of capital formation. These 
areas include: (1) capital acquisition brokers (CABs) and other “limited purpose” broker-
dealer models designed to support capital formation; (2) research analysts and research 
reports; and (3) other NASD or FINRA rules, guidance and processes impacting capital 
raising. 

•  Modern Workplace. Key areas where the rules or related regulatory requirements may affect 

or create unnecessary challenges for how member firms organize and operate their 
workplace with modern technology and related practices. These areas include 
requirements regarding: (1) branch offices and remote work; (2) registered representative 
credentialing and education; (3) means of internal and customer communications 
(e.g. electronic delivery); and (4) recordkeeping practices, particularly with respect to 
communications. 

 For the purposes of this initial comment, we believe FINRA should consider the following regarding 
capital formation. We will submit comments concerning the “Modern Workplace” in future 
comment submissions. 

A. Concerning Capital Formation: New Category of Firm and MAP 

FINRA should consider a new general category of ""broker-dealer."" Indeed, as firms within this 
category would operate neither as ""brokers"" or ""dealers"" within the fuller meaning of these terms, 
the term ""broker-dealer"" would not be used. The category of firm we are referring to would include 
those firms that do not maintain customer “accounts” within the ordinary meaning of ""accounts"" 
(the commercial relationship would be construed as the servicing of ""clients"" rather than 
""accounts""). Such category would include Capital Acquisition Broker-Dealers (“CABs”), securities  

1 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
research-only firms, and other firms where there are no customer accounts, such as firms that 
serve as placement agents for private funds. This general category may be referred to as ""Non-
Customer Account Securities Firms"" (""NCASFs""). (I use this appellation for discussion purposes 
only.) 

NCASFs would be exempt from any of the rules that relate to or pertain to opening customer 
accounts, including AML, KYC, ATF, and CDD rules. They would operate pursuant to substantially 
simplified compliance policies and procedures that address only their specific operations. 

As for annual or bi-annual AML examinations, all NCASFs would be exempt from such AML 
examination obligations. Further, for NCASFs, it is proposed that there should be no minimum net 
capital requirement or aggregate indebtedness standard, nor should there be any requirement to 
have annual financial audits by PCAOB or other qualified financial auditing firms. 

A minimum net capital requirement would no longer be imposed on NCASFs. Even the minimum 
$5,000 net capital requirement makes little sense for a firm that operates in the limited ways 
described, and such requirement only presents the occasion for a ""violation"" of net capital rules 
where such rules do little or nothing to secure the markets or to protect the public interest. 

As well, NCASFs should not be required to qualify a General Securities Principal, a Financial and 
Operations Principal, or other limited purpose principal for supervision purposes. However, FINRA 
may consider reviving the Series 62 qualification, which covers a wide range of corporate securities, 
as well as require the SIE for all persons directly associated with the limited purpose activities of 
the firm. For firms that only prepare “research reports,” the current Series 86 and 87 (and 
exemptions therefrom) requirements would still apply, and the relevant provisions of Rule 2241 
would continue to apply. 

Working in conjunction with the Securities and Exchange Commission and the National Futures 
Association, it would be made clear that NCASFs would not be deemed (unless their other 
activities indicate otherwise) to be “investment advisers” or “commodity trading advisers,” as those 
terms are currently defined in statues and as used in applicable rules. 

Benefits of the NCASF Category: The NCASF category would greatly reduce administrative, 
compliance, cost, and regulatory risk burdens. In addition, firms with such limited operations 
would free FINRA and other regulators to focus on firms where there are greater market risks and 
greater risks concerning investor abuse.

B. Concerning Capital Formation: The MAP Process 

Another area that is very much in need of reform, in our view, is the Membership Application 
Program (“MAP”). The MAP process for new members as well as for “Continuing Membership 
Applications” has become quite elaborate and complex over the years and, to some degree and at 
times, onerous. Rules 1014 and 1017 provide the standards for applications, but over the years the 
requirements for specific types of document submission, and the form of submission, have 
become excessive and requests by MAP staff have at times been unclear, leading to substantial 
delays. While we plan to, in a future comment submission, propose a series of suggestions 
concerning the MAP process, the general comments we will provide presently are as follows: 

1.      MAP should rely more on representations made during the application process and less on pro 
forma documentation that, while based upon honest assumptions in view of known factors, may be 
substantially revised during the initial year of the applicant’s operation, due to all sorts of 
experiential factors (decision to redomicile, to pay bonuses, to make purchases of furniture and 
technology unforeseen during the application process, etc.). 

2.      Pro forma projections should be used to establish reasonable but general operating scenarios 
rather than as firm indications of the revenue, expense and net capital experience that will obtain, 
especially when the owners of the firm have demonstrated that sufficient capital is on-hand should 
the member firm require it, and that the applicant’s principals are duly qualified and experienced to 
handle changes in the business plan and operations. In our view, MAP need not micromanage or 
seek guarantees that the business plan will unfold as initially assumed. Many business plans do 
not. 

3.      It should be clarified that, in cases where a change of control is on offer, the change of control 
may in fact proceed after a substantially complete application is submitted, and that the 
preclusion of the change of control cannot be a “restriction” imposed by MAP after 30 days have 
elapsed from the time of the substantially complete submission. 

4.      In general, representations made by applicants should be relied upon by MAP, rather than 
stressed during the application process. For example, representations concerning sources of 
funding, office resources, the experience of proposed registered representatives and principals, 
and other representations should be accepted unless there is a reasonable basis to believe that the 
representations are misleading. Should, upon subsequent FINRA examination, a determination be 
made that a firm materially misled MAP during the application process, FINRA could discipline 
such firm as deemed appropriate. 

As stated, we will have additional comments concerning the MAP process in a future submission. 

3 

 
 
 
 
 
Benefits of a Streamlined MAP Program: The benefits, in terms of capital formation, are 
substantial. As far as FINRA staff time is concerned, initial and continuing applications would be 
concluded in substantially less time. As far as applicants are concerned, business operations as 
well as changes to existing business operations will be able to proceed more quickly, allowing firms 
to generate revenue without undue time lags. 

We appreciate the technology that has been employed to make applications less paper-intensive. 
This has been a plus for the application process. However, we believe the use of the various 
application portals has also led to a proliferation of document submissions, records, and 
representations that has led the application process to become unwieldy and, for the applicant, 
fraught with uncertainties as to whether the submissions, however comprehensive, are sufficient to 
satisfy MAP staff.

However, we believe the use of the various application portals has also led to a proliferation of document submissions, records, and representations that has led the application process to become unwieldy and, for the applicant, fraught with uncertainties as to whether the submissions, however comprehensive, are sufficient to satisfy MAP staff.",0.9924,0.067,0.03

In regards to Regulatory Notice 25-04

We would like to note that, in our opinion, the Net Capital Requirement using FASB 606 improperly penalizes firms
for invoicing clients. Issuing an invoice in advance of receiving payment creates a corresponding dollar-for-dollar
negative impact on Net Capital.

FASB 606 became effective for private companies in 2019. Under this standard, revenue must be recognized when
the entity satisfies the performance obligation. For our retainers, this means recognizing revenue on a straight-line
basis over the life of the engagement.

Key Points:

During the month an invoice is issued:

Accounts Receivable increases by the invoice amount.
Unearned Revenue is recorded at the full invoice amount.
Retained Earnings Impact is $0.

Net Capital Calculation:

Accounts Receivable is considered a Non-Allowable Asset.
Therefore, when an invoice is issued:

Retained Earnings does not increase.
Non-Allowable Assets increase.
This results in a temporary reduction in Net Capital.

Financial Impact:

The company is financially better off before the invoice is issued and after the invoice is paid.

Re:  

FINRA Regulatory Notice 25-04: Rule Modernization   

Dear Mr. Shaikun and Ms. Seidel,    

Financial Information Forum (“FIF”) is submitting this comment letter in response to Regulatory Notice 
25-04 (Rule Modernization) published by the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (“FINRA”) on 
March 12, 2025 (the “Regulatory Notice”).1 In the Regulatory Notice, FINRA seeks feedback on “What 
specific FINRA rules should be a focus for modernization based on their economic costs and benefits; 
changes in markets, products, services, or technology; or otherwise?”2 FIF members support FINRA’s 
publication of the Regulatory Notice and FINRA’s focus on modernizing its rules.  

This comment letter is specifically focused on FINRA Rule 4560, Short Interest Reporting. This letter does 
not seek to address issues of concern for FIF members relating to other existing FINRA rules. This letter 
reflects the discussions of the FIF Short Sales / Reg SHO / Short Reporting Working Group. 

FINRA writes that the policy objective for short interest reporting is “to help investors gauge the market 
sentiment surrounding a security or exchange.”3 This policy objective can only be achieved through an 
accurate reporting of short positions. FIF members have identified at least two issues with the current 
implementation of Rule 4560 that impede this objective. First, the rule introduces transaction reporting 
elements into a position reporting system. This introduces significant and unnecessary complexity into 
short interest reporting and reduces the quality of the data that is disseminated to the public by

distorting the short positions that firms report. FINRA and the exchanges separately disseminate 
information about short sale transactions.4 Positions and transactions should be reported separately, 
without commingling of the two concepts. Second, the current ambiguity regarding how a firm should 
define a principal “account” for short interest reporting could restrict firms from netting principal long 
and short positions, thereby materially overstating the economic short positions of reporting firms.   

Conflation of transaction and position reporting 

FINRA should revise Rule 4560 to provide for firms to report based on their actual short positions 
without regard to the underlying transactions. 

Under FINRA Rule 4560(b), firms are required to report short positions only if they result from (1) “short 
sales” or (2) certain sales that are marked “long”. This provision introduces transaction reporting 
elements into a position reporting system. This creates two significant problems. First, it means that the 
short interest report that FINRA purports to be disseminating is not in fact a true short interest report. 
Instead, it is a short interest report distorted by transaction reporting elements. Second, Rule 4560(b) 
imposes a significant and unnecessary burden on firms to track the details of the underlying transactions 
as opposed to reporting based on their current positions. This is often a complex process given the 
complexity of the short and long marking requirements of Regulation SHO, including the complexity 
relating to “deemed to own"" determinations.5  

The following are additional examples of the challenges caused by the current conflation of transaction 
and position reporting: 

•  Trades executed away from a prime broker. Under FAQ Q13, with respect to trades that are not 
executed by a prime broker, the prime broker “… should not automatically assume that such 
trades are ‘short sales,’ as defined by Rule 200(a) of Regulation SHO, and must take steps to 
verify the true nature of the position before reporting it as short interest pursuant to Rule 
4560.”6 This imposes a significant and unnecessary burden on the prime broker. 

•  Errors. Under FAQ Q9, “Short positions in error accounts resulting from transactions placed into 
the error account, e.g., journaled from a firm or customer account or re-booked to an error 
account, shall be reported as short interest if, prior to being placed or re-booked into the error 
account, the original, underlying transaction was a ‘short sale’ as defined by Rule 200(a) of 
Regulation SHO, or a transaction that was marked ‘long,’ consistent with Regulation SHO, e.g. 
aggregation units.”7 This imposes a significant and unnecessary burden on the reporting firm. It 
is also noteworthy that a short position in an error account is a principal short position of a firm 
regardless of the nature of the associated customer transactions. 

4 See, for example, FINRA, Monthly Short Sale Volume Files, available at https://www.finra.org/finra-data/browse-
catalog/short-sale-volume-data/monthly-short-sale-volume-files. 
5 See 17 CFR §242.200.

These burdens can be avoided by having firms report based on their short positions without regard to 
the underlying transactions. This approach also would result in reporting of short positions without the 
distortion caused by introducing transaction reporting elements into a position reporting system. As one 
example of this approach, error account positions should be counted as part of a firm’s principal 
position without regard to the underlying transactions. 

Reporting based on economic short positions 

FINRA Rule 4560(a) requires that firms report “gross short positions existing in each individual firm or 
customer account.” Rule 4560 does not define what is meant by an “account”. This creates an ambiguity 
as to whether firms can define this based on the firm’s economic position.  

For example, consider the following scenario: Firm A has a short position of 10,000 shares in Account A1 
and a long position of 6,000 shares in Account A2; and Firm B has a short position of 4,000 shares in 
Account B1. Both firms have an economic short position of 4,000 shares. Firm B reports a short position 
of 4,000 shares, but it is not clear whether Firm A is required to report a short position of 10,000 shares, 
which would overstate Firm A’s economic short position. Firm A also could journal its short position in 
Account A1 into Account A2. This would result in Firm A reporting a short position of 4,000 shares rather 
than 10,000 shares even though Firm A’s economic position has not changed. We could also consider 
Firm C, which has a trading unit with a short position of 10,000 shares, a long position of 6,000 shares, 
and an economic short position of 4,000 shares. It is not clear whether Firm C should classify its trading 
unit as an account for purposes of short interest reporting and/or whether it can classify a structure 
(e.g., an aggregation unit) in which the unit sits as the account for short interest reporting.   

Stated more generally, a firm’s account structure is distinct from its economic position. A firm could 
establish separate accounts for individual traders, for individual desks or for any number of other 
reasons, but whether a firm holds its positions in a security in one or multiple accounts does not change 
the firm’s economic position.  

When making investment decisions, market participants consider the short interest data disseminated 
by FINRA. FIF members are concerned that the over-reporting of short positions that results from the 
current lack of clarity on this issue, in addition to providing inaccurate data to market participants, has 
led to unnecessary market instability in the past and will continue to do so in the future, if not 
addressed. 

To address this issue, FIF members recommend that FINRA provide interpretive guidance (or 
alternatively provide exemptive relief) to allow a firm to net principal short and long positions for 
purposes of short interest reporting (i.e., to treat these positions as a single account). This guidance or 
relief should include the following conditions:  

•  The positions are principal positions for the same beneficial owner (i.e., the principal positions 

being netted are for the same beneficial owner) 

•  These principal positions are for the same aggregation unit within the firm 

FINANCIAL INFORMATION FORUM

•  These principal positions are in the same reportable security (in other words, a short equity 

position would not be offset by a long option or other derivative position). 

As noted above, a firm’s account structure often has no bearing on a firm’s true economic short 
position. Failing to define what constitutes an “account” within the rule potentially leads to inconsistent 
reporting of short interest across similarly situated firms with principal positions and distorts what 
would be considered truly a short position (i.e., the “market sentiment”) from the investing public’s 
perspective.

FIF members appreciate the opportunity to comment on the Regulatory Notice and support FINRA’s 
solicitation of input on rule modernization. FIF members recommend that FINRA consider how this 
process could be formalized into a longer-term process that would enable market participants, on an 
ongoing basis, to provide recommendations relating to existing FINRA rules.

Feedback on margin calls
Wednesday, May 21, 2025 10:53:04 AM

WARNING: External Sender! Exercise caution with links, attachments and
requests for login information.

I would like to submit feedback about the regulations. I don't know what is wrong exactly with
the way margin is enforced by the brokers, but they never seem able to explain to me why I
get margin calls for trading in the extended or overnight hours. I think what is going on is that
I'm buying penny stocks and then in the extended hours the value of the penny stock goes
down (or goes up) and my maintenance margin is recalculated but I'm not notified of this. This
has happened at multiple brokerages, and then i get day trade buying power margin calls.
Please make sure the industry regulations require brokers to keep clients updated and warned
about potential violations during extended hours. If margin maintenance and DTBP is affected
by changes in the extended hours, then clients should be notified. 

Also, the brokers should be required to provide the clients with the exact transaction and
reason that the margin call occurred. 

Thanks

Noah Glassman

Dear Ms. Mitchell: 

Thank  you  for  the  opportunity  to  respond  to  this  Regulatory  NoDce  25-04,  soliciDng  member 
feedback regarding key areas where FINRA’s rules or related regulatory requirements may aﬀect 
or create unnecessary challenges for member ﬁrms’ support of capital formaDon. We wish to 
address part (3) of this request, (3) other NASD or FINRA rules, guidance and processes impac=ng 
capital raising. 

North  Capital  Private  SecuriDes  CorporaDon  (NCPS)  has  been  involved  in  private  securiDes 
markets since registering with the SecuriDes and Exchange Commission and becoming a member 
of FINRA in 2011, and I have personally worked in public and private markets since 1985. NCPS 
and  its  aﬃliates  have  been  involved  in  over  3,950  public  and  private  exempt  oﬀerings  as  an 
agency  broker-dealer,  placement  agent,  subscripDon  escrow  facilitator,  ATS,  or  technology 
services provider, with over 2.2 million transacDons and nearly $8 billion of volume. Most of our 
primary  oﬀering  business  has  been  with  retail  accredited  investors  in  exempt  oﬀerings  issued 
under  RegulaDon  D,  Rule  506(c).  From  its  incepDon,  NCPS  has  operated  as  a  registered 
intermediary because of our convicDon that broker-dealers play a criDcal role in veeng deals and 
sponsors and in promoDng full disclosure, fair markets, and investor protecDon. 

The  central  tenet  of  U.S.  securiDes  regulaDons  for  over  90  years  is  that  they  are  rooted  in  a 
disclosure-based  system.  RegulaDons  are  designed  to  ensure  that  investors  have  access  to 
complete informaDon about issuers and their oﬀerings, based on the premise that an informed 
investor  can  make  their  own  investment  decisions  given  a  fair,  balanced  and  complete 
presentaDon of the key elements and risks of an investment oﬀering.

I write today to respecjully request a revision or withdrawal of FINRA’s expansive interpreDve 
guidance related to Rule 2210, which undermines this principle and is counterproducDve to the 
objecDve of full and fair disclosure. The text of Rule 2210(d)(1)(F) states:  

“Communica=ons may not predict or project performance, imply that past performance 
will recur or make any exaggerated or unwarranted claim, opinion or forecast; provided, 
however, that this paragraph (d)(1)(F) does not prohibit: 

(i)  A hypothe=cal illustra=on of mathema=cal principles, provided that it does not 
predict or project the performance of an investment or investment strategy; 
(ii)  An  investment  analysis  tool,  or  a  wriLen  report  produced  by  an  investment 

analysis tool, that meets the requirements of Rule 2214; and 

(iii)  A price target contained in a research report on debt or equity securi=es, provided 
that the price target has a reasonable basis, the report discloses the valua=on 
methods used to determine the price target, and the price target is accompanied 
by  disclosure  concerning  the  risks  that  may  impede  achievement  of  the  price 
target.” 

The Rule as it is wriCen is not problemaDc.  A predicDon or projecDon of the performance of a 
speciﬁc investment is generally not warranted, and on this point most investment professionals 
would agree. However, the interpreDve guidance issued in Regulatory NoDces, FAQs,1 in direct 
review of adverDsing submissions, and during the member examinaDon process, goes far beyond 
the leCer of Rule 2210.  

Any reference to an investment performance metric, in any context and however well-qualiﬁed, 
is  considered  by  FINRA  to  be  “misleading”  and  a  “predicDon  or  projecDon.”  The  terms 
“predicDon”  and  “projecDon”  have  been  wrongly  conﬂated  with  “target”  and  “objecDve,”  an 
overreaching interpretaDon of the Rule that is harming investors.2  

Many individual investments and most real estate projects are underwriCen to a parDcular return 
objecDve. Investors deserve to know what that return objecDve is, especially when they directly

2  FINRA has indicated that a well-qualiﬁed statement with a numeric return objec‘ve, even when accompanied by 
a statement that such objec‘ve is a goal and is not and should not be considered a predic‘on or projec‘on, and 
regardless of whether such objec‘ve is stated in the prospectus, violates Rule 2210(d)(1)(F).

ask for it. An objecDve is not a predicDon, it is not a projecDon, and quanDfying a return objecDve 
does  not  suggest  or  imply  that  the  investment  will  achieve  the  objecDve.  StaDng  a  return 
objecDve is not misleading. It is trivial to qualify such statements with appropriately balancing 
disclosures, such as: “There is no guarantee that the return objec=ve will be achieved. The return 
objec=ve is not and should not be considered a predic=on, projec=on, or es=mate of performance 
of the investment, which is subject to the risk of loss in its en=rety.”  

Not being able to present a return objecDve for a project-style investment is anDtheDcal to market 
convenDon in real estate invesDng, as well-underwriCen deals rouDnely include a stated return 
objecDve,  a  detailed  ﬁnancial  model,  and  robust  risk  disclosures  and  qualifying  statements  as 
central  elements  of  the  oﬀering  package.  Moreover,  omieng  criDcal  informaDon  such  as  the 
return objecDve of a project is insulDng to the intelligence of investors, who are implicitly viewed 
as  too  unsophisDcated  to  understand  that  an  investment  objecDve  is  not  the  same  as  actual 
return, even though FINRA has now acknowledged that qualiﬁed purchasers may need to know 
this informaDon.  

Finally, the interpreDve guidance around Rule 2210 is broadly considered by most investment 
professionals to be so wildly oﬀ-market that many prospecDve issuers simply choose not to work 
with a broker-dealer rather than submit to Rules that are out of step with common sense and 
common pracDce. Investors are more likely to be harmed when an issuer who is predisposed to 
work with a broker-dealer decides not to, because it means that no due diligence on the oﬀering 
will  be  conducted,  no  investor  suitability  reviews  will  be  performed,  and  no  safeguarding  of 
customer funds will be undertaken by a regulated enDty. And when outside the purview of FINRA 
oversight, investors will ask for and receive a statement of the return objecDve from the sponsor, 
generally with fewer and possibly incomplete disclosures. 

FINRA has recognized that the inclusion of performance metrics for ProjecDon-Eligible Investors 
should  be  permiCed,  and  it  has  proposed  an  amendment  to  Rule  2210  to  allow  such  use.3 
However,  this  proposed  amendment  does  not  go  far  enough.  The  core  issue  is  not  the 
sophisDcaDon of the audience, it is the deﬁniDon and scope of “predicDon or projecDon,” which 
has been inappropriately expanded through interpretaDon to cover all references to targets and 
objecDves, regardless of how well-qualiﬁed the analysis and references might be. 

Revising  or  withdrawing  this  guidance  would  allow  for  a  more  sensible  framework:  one  that 
recognizes  that  all  investors  have  an  interest  in  understanding  the  risk  and  return  objecDves, 
expressed in quanDtaDve terms, of investments they are considering. Moreover, ensuring that 
FINRA  rules  do  not  push  issuers  away  from  the  regulated  ecosystem  of  broker-dealers  would 
enhance investor protecDon and market integrity.

Re:  Broad  Review  to  Modernize  Rules  Regarding Member Firms and Associated 
Persons, Regulatory Notice 25-04 

Dear Ms. Mitchell: 

I write on behalf of Open to the Public Investing, Inc. (“Public”), a FINRA-licensed 
broker-dealer (CRD: 127818).  We oﬀer brokerage services to self-directed customers 
through the Public.com website and the Public mobile app (the ""Public Platform"" or 
""Platform"").  On our Platform, retail investors can build modern, diversiﬁed portfolios 
spanning US-listed stocks and ETFs, high-yield cash sweeps, options, bonds, and 
cryptocurrencies.   

We appreciate the opportunity to suggest areas where FINRA rules could beneﬁt from 
a fresh look.  We believe that FINRA Rule 7730, which governs the fees assessed on 
member ﬁrms by the Trade Reporting and Compliance Engine (“TRACE”), should be 
amended to encourage greater retail participation in the bond market by lowering the 
TRACE fees charged for smaller bond transactions.   

Last year, Public launched “fractional bond trading,” which allows retail investors to 
purchase bonds in increments as small as $100 par.1  We did this in response to 
growing investor demand for yield products in a high interest rate environment and 
because of the meaningful advantages direct bond ownership can provide for many 
retail investors compared to mutual funds and ETFs.

A signiﬁcant obstacle to broader adoption of fractional bond trading, however, is that 
FINRA currently charges a ﬂat $0.475 TRACE fee for trades under $200,000, regardless 
of transaction size.  For smaller trades, this fee is disproportionately high.  For example, 
a $100 bond purchase can incur up to a 95-basis-point fee, since brokers must pay 
TRACE fees on both the purchase and sale legs of the transaction.  On average, 
TRACE fees consume approximately 34% of Public Investing’s total revenue on 
corporate bond transactions each month, making it economically challenging to scale 
fractional bond oﬀerings for retail investors. 

We recommend reducing TRACE fees for bond trades with a par value under 
$1,000 to $.0475 a trade.  Doing so would lower costs for retail investors, improve 
access to the bond market, and provide greater incentives for brokers to innovate and 
better serve retail investors.  

Public’s Launch of Fractional Bond Trading Has Successfully Opened the Market  
to Retail Investors  

In 2019, Public was one of the first broker-dealers to offer real-time fractional share 
trading, enabling clients to build diversified portfolios of equities and ETFs with smaller 
investments than traditionally required.  Building on that experience, we launched fixed 
income trading in 2023, starting with a Treasuries Account that allows clients to invest 
as little as $100 in 6-month T-Bills.  Given prevailing yields, this product quickly became 
one of the fastest-growing assets on our platform. 

We subsequently expanded our offerings to include a wide range of corporate and 
government bonds.  However, we quickly found that typical minimum transaction 
sizes—$1,000 par for corporate bonds and $5,000 for municipal bonds—were too large 
for many retail investors to achieve meaningful diversification.  Furthermore, meaningful 
liquidity is not always available at these minimum sizes, aggravating this challenge by 
effectively shutting out smaller investors from directly accessing the bond market. 

To solve this, we reduced the minimum corporate and government bond transaction size 
to $100 par.  Through our partnership with Moment Markets, we implemented a new 
order routing and liquidity aggregation platform that enables us to access liquidity 
across venues and offer smaller lot sizes at competitive prices—further enhancing 
access for retail investors. 

Adoption on Public’s platform has been strong, and growing, but the small average 
trade size has led to significant TRACE fees that inhibit our ability to grow the product.  
To put it concretely, in the month of March 2025, Public Investing customers made 
approximately 23,000 corporate bond trades, with an average trade size of about $520.  
On these trades, Public Investing paid $21,722 in aggregate TRACE fees on 

 
approximately $63,000 of revenue.  In other words, 34% of every dollar we make goes 
toward TRACE fees and TRACE fees act as an implied markup of approximately 18 
basis points on each transaction. 

While we remain committed to offering these products to our customers, the economics 
of high transaction-based fees make it difficult to justify additional investment in 
offerings that could meaningfully benefit retail investors.  

Changes to TRACE Will Further Increase Accessibility to Fixed-Income 

We support regulatory efforts that increase transparency and level the playing field for 
retail investors, and TRACE is no exception.  However, we believe that the current 
TRACE fee structure for corporate and agency bonds disproportionately penalizes 
smaller transactions while benefiting larger institutional transactions. 

Under the current fee structure, TRACE charges: 

●  $0.475 per trade for transactions up to $200,000 in par value; 

●  $0.002375 per $1,000 in par value for transactions between $200,000 and 

$999,999; 

●  A flat $2.375 per trade for transactions of $1,000,000 or more in par value. 

Every broker incurs at least two TRACE fees when selling a corporate or agency bond 
to a retail investor: one when purchasing a bond from the marketplace and another 
when selling that bond (or part of that bond) to the client.2  This structure gives larger 
brokers—who can purchase bonds in larger quantities—a meaningful advantage over 
smaller brokers due to the lower overall TRACE fees paid on larger transactions, as 
shown by the chart below.

2 For introducing brokers, which tend to be smaller than brokers that are self-clearing, there may be 
additional TRACE fees paid by the clearing broker for bonds it subsequently sells to the introducing 
broker.  These fees would only further reduce margins and increase the total amount paid by the retail 
client. 

 
 
 
 
 
In this hypothetical example, a $1,000,000 bond trade incurs just $2.375 in TRACE 
fees, equivalent to 0.02375 basis points. By contrast, a $1,000 bond transaction incurs 
a $0.475 fee, or 4.75 basis points. As a result, a $1,000 sale executed by a broker that 
initially purchased the bond as part of a $1,000,000 trade incurs a total TRACE fee of 
approximately 4.77 basis points. However, a broker that initially purchased the bond as 
part of a $1,000 trade to fulfill the same retail order would incur a total TRACE fee of 9.5 
basis points—double the cost on an effective basis. This disparity becomes even more 
pronounced for fractional bond trades. For example, if an introducing broker purchases 
just $100 in par value of a bond from its clearing broker and resells it to a client, the 
effective total TRACE fee for that transaction would be approximately 95 basis points. 

The SEC originally approved the TRACE fee scheduled based on the belief that: 

[T]he proposal provides for the equitable allocation of reasonable fees, 
dues, and other charges, and does not permit unfair discrimination 
between clients, issuers, brokers, or dealers. For example, in several 
instances, the TRACE fee structure adopts a sliding scale approach. The 
Commission believes that this sliding scale structure promotes an 
equitable distribution of the relevant fees while reducing the possibility of 
unfair discrimination between clients, issuers, brokers, or dealers.3   

We agree with the SEC’s assessment, but we believe that the current structure now 
deviates from this goal.  The current TRACE fee schedule was designed at a time when 
the fixed-income market was almost exclusively institutional.  Given the significant 
growth in retail participation, it is time to modernize the fee structure to better reflect the 
evolving dynamics of the market.  

We Propose Lowering TRACE Fees for Sub-$1000 trades 

We propose a targeted adjustment to the TRACE fee schedule in Rule 7730: reduce the 
TRACE fee for trades involving bonds with a par value under $1,000 from $0.475 to 
$0.0475. 

Because trades under $1,000 par currently represent a small fraction of overall TRACE 
volume, this change is unlikely to affect FINRA’s ability to maintain TRACE.  In fact, a 
more inclusive market could ultimately expand participation and improve TRACE’s 
sustainability over the long term by increasing trading volumes.4 

3 See Securities Exchange Act Release No. 46145 (footnote omitted) (June 28, 2002), 67 FR 44911 at 
44913 (July 5, 2002) (File No. SR-NASD-2002-63). 
4 FINRA may also wish to consider broader changes to Rule 7730 that would further level the playing 
field. For example, FINRA could apply the same per-par-value fee scale used for trades between 
$200,000 and $999,999 to both larger and smaller transactions. This would align the fee structure more 
closely with the SEC’s goal of preventing unfair discrimination among market participants.  Alternatively, 

 
 
Beneﬁts of this Proposal 

Lowering TRACE fees for smaller bond transactions will allow for greater direct 
ownership of bonds and for the construction of well-diversiﬁed ﬁxed income portfolios 
for a broader segment of the retail investor population.  Direct bond ownership has 
meaningful advantages over traditional corporate bond mutual funds for retail investors 
including:  

●  Duration Management:  Direct bond ownership allows investors to tailor the 
duration of their portfolios to match personal risk tolerance, cash ﬂow needs, 
and investment horizons.  Mutual funds and ETFs, by contrast, are typically 
managed to speciﬁc durations that may not align with investor preferences or 
needs. 

●  Lower Management Fees:  By building their own ﬁxed income portfolios, 

investors can avoid the fees associated with actively managed bond funds or 
bond ETFs if they so choose.  This results in greater transparency and improved 
long-term returns, particularly for fee-sensitive investors. 

●  Tax Management:  Retail investors who directly own individual bonds have 

greater ﬂexibility to manage their tax exposure over time.  For example, they can 
hold certain bonds to maturity to defer taxable gains—capabilities not always 
available through mutual funds or ETFs, which often generate taxable events 
regardless of an investor’s speciﬁc strategy or timing.  

In addition to beneﬁting retail investors, these changes would also improve the ﬁxed 
income capital markets more broadly: 

● 

Increasing Liquidity:  Enabling more retail participation will increase demand for 
bond trades in smaller amounts—improving liquidity and price discovery across 
the bond market, especially in parts of the market dominated by large 
institutional block trades. 

●  Driving Investment in Retail-Focused Infrastructure:  As retail activity grows, 
ﬁrms will have greater incentive to invest in infrastructure that supports small-lot 
ﬁxed income trading.  This includes improvements in liquidity, routing, execution 
quality, and pricing transparency—all of which will beneﬁt the market ecosystem 
as a whole and accomplish through private ordering long needed reforms and 
increased electroniﬁcation of the ﬁxed-income markets. 

●  Disincentivizing “Creditor-on-Creditor Violence”:  By broadening the investor 
base and increasing the number of bondholders, the risk that concentrated 
institutional creditors can act unilaterally, or in concert with issuers, in 
restructurings or distressed scenarios will decrease.  A more dispersed 
ownership base helps promote fairer outcomes and discourages aggressive 

FINRA could maintain the existing fixed fee for trades over $1,000,000 while extending the current scaled 
fee schedule downward to apply to trades below $200,000. 

 
tactics that may disadvantage smaller investors and less sophisticated 
institutional investors. 

●  Leveling the Playing Field between Brokers:  The current TRACE fee structure 
favors large institutional broker-dealers with the ability to purchase bonds in 
larger blocks and, as discussed above, reduce their eﬀective TRACE fees 
substantially.  Adjusting fees for smaller trades would level the playing ﬁeld for 
retail-focused broker-dealers, enhancing competition, spurring innovation, and 
ultimately expanding access to ﬁxed income investing for millions of individual 
investors. 

We welcome any opportunity to engage on these or any other subjects about making 
retail investing fairer and providing opportunities for our members to save and invest for 
their futures. 

We look forward to the opportunity to discuss our proposal with you and your team. 

Sincerely,

Re: Regulatory No4ce 25-04 (FINRA Launches Broad Review to Modernize Rules Regarding    

Member Firms and Associated Persons) – Member Feedback on FINRA Rule 6600 and Rule 
6610 Procedures 

Dear Ms. Mitchell: 

Thank  you  for  the  opportunity  to  respond  to  this  Regulatory  NoEce  25-04,  soliciEng  member 
feedback regarding key areas where FINRA’s rules or related regulatory requirements may aﬀect 
or create unnecessary challenges for member ﬁrms’ support of capital formaEon. We wish to 
address part (3) of this request, (3) other NASD or FINRA rules, guidance and processes impac=ng 
capital raising. 

North Capital Private SecuriEes CorporaEon operates the PPEX AlternaEve Trading System (“PPEX 
ATS”)  hDp://www.ppex.com  for  exempt  securiEes.    The  PPEX  ATS  currently  lists  and  trades 
approximately  500  equity  lisEngs,  and  all  trades  are  reported  by  the  Firm  through  CAT,  which 
requires a unique symbol for each lisEng.   

We respecfully request that FINRA modify its procedure for obtaining a symbol, so that a 
member can request and receive a symbol prior to the commencement of trading if it has a 
reasonable belief that the ﬁrst trade will occur within 30 days. 

PPEX ATS currently facilitates trades in over-the-counter equiEes (OTCE). FINRA rule 6600 “OTC 
ReporEng Facility” and FINRA Rule 6620 “ReporEng TransacEons in OTC Equity SecuriEes and 
Restricted Equity SecuriEes” outline the standards that PPEX ATS follows to report OTCE security 
trades to the over-the-counter reporEng facility (ORF). AddiEonally, PPEX ATS reports OTCE 
orders and trades to the Consolidated Audit Trail (CAT), established through SEC Rule 613. To 
fulﬁll trade reporEng obligaEons to ORF and CAT, each OTCE security requires a symbol issued 
by FINRA.

Currently, it is not possible to obtain a symbol unEl ajer a trade in the name has occurred. 
Because the PPEX ATS is a matching market for exempt and other unlisted securiEes, we have 
no ability to control or inﬂuence when a “ﬁrst trade” might occur.  Whenever a ﬁrst trade does 
print, we promptly apply for a symbol and FINRA responds in a Emely manner.  However, every 
trade (including the ﬁrst trade) that occurs prior to the issuance of a symbol must be reported 
as a late trade.  Depending on how many new securiEes are traded for the ﬁrst Eme on a given 
day, the volume of trades in such securiEes, and the total volume of trades in all securiEes on 
the PPEX ATS, this process triggers “late ﬁling” red ﬂags through CAT reporEng, which creates 
cascading excepEon reports and examinaEon requests that are extraordinarily Eme consuming 
but provide no useful informaEon.  It is predictable and explainable that trades will be reported 
late whenever a new symbol is issued, because there is no possible way to NOT report trades 
late given the design of the FINRA procedure. 

There is a simple ﬁx that could be easily implemented by FINRA:  allow member ﬁrms to request 
symbols before trading begins, which would immediately eliminate 100% of erroneous late 
reporEng that is a solely a result of the symbol request process.  This is a low risk / high impact 
change that we urge FINRA to implement promptly. 

Thank you for your consideraEon.

Re: 

NSCP Comment Letter FINRA Regulatory Notice 25-04 

Dear Ms. Piorko Mitchell: 

The National Society of Compliance Professionals (“NSCP”) submits this letter in response to the request by 
FINRA in Regulatory Notice 25-04 for comments related to FINRA’s efforts to modernize its rules. We 
appreciate this opportunity to provide feedback as well as FINRA’s past efforts to seek stakeholder input to 
help shape or reshape its rules under which FINRA-member broker-dealers must operate. NSCP also 
appreciates the opportunities that we have had to meet with FINRA’s senior leadership on a regular basis to 
share our input and perspectives related to the impact of FINRA’s rules and processes on our members. We 
believe that regulatory oversight is most effective when regulators view compliance professionals as partners 
with the shared objectives of investor protection, market integrity and the promotion of capital formation. 
Since its founding in 1986, NSCP has been the leading non-profit membership organization dedicated to 
supporting compliance professionals in the financial services industry focusing primarily on broker-dealers, 
investment advisers and private funds. Our members are responsible for implementing and maintaining 
policies and procedures that are reasonably designed to ensure compliance with FINRA’s rules along with a 
large number of laws and rules enacted by a number of federal and state regulators and other Self-Regulatory 
Organizations. To do so, our broker-dealer members are required to qualify and register with FINRA, the 
Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) and various state regulators. Our members are subject to 
personal and professional liability resulting from this registration. As discussed below, NSCP has developed 
and issued a framework to help regulators analyze chief compliance officer (“CCO”) liability in a way that 
provides a real-world perspective regarding the impact of perceived CCO liability on the profession. In 
addition, and as described in more detail below, NSCP has just completed and issued a BD/IA Regulatory 
Mapping Tool. One of the primary objectives of NSCP in developing this tool is to provide a comprehensive 
view of the considerable number of rules and regulations for which our members are responsible.  

In this letter, we outline specific themes that we believe will assist regulators assess their rules and guidance 
to promote effective compliance and help empower compliance professionals to support the shared 
objectives of investor protection, market integrity and the support of capital formation. We welcome  
opportunities to work with FINRA and other regulators to provide input, feedback and data to help support 
these efforts. We appreciate this opportunity to respond, and we look forward to continuing to work with 
FINRA and other regulators to help support our shared objectives.

1.  Provide opportunities for input from impacted stakeholders, particularly compliance personnel, early in 

the rulemaking and review process. 

• 

• 

Input from industry practitioners including impacted compliance professionals should be considered in 
the early stages of evaluation. This would provide more information and alternatives for most 
effectively and efficiently achieving intended outcomes. 
Incorporating stakeholder input in the early stages could reduce the number of comments later in the 
process and ultimately shorten the process. 

•  Early input could be obtained through a formalized Compliance Advisory Committee, concept 

releases, roundtables and/or other crowd-sourced solutions. 

2.  Minimize ambiguity with regard to requirements and expectations of the rule(s) while allowing 

flexibility in terms of how those rules are implemented. 
•  Avoid ambiguity and subjectivity regarding requirements as much as possible. 
•  Provide as much flexibility as possible with regard to how the rules are implemented allowing the 

application and execution of the requirements to be tailored based on business, operations, and risks. 
•  Provide more practical guidance and tangible examples in adopting releases and subsequent guidance 

as possible. 

•  Where possible, tier rules in such a way that smaller firms are not disproportionately burdened. 

3.  Allow appropriate time for implementation. 

•  Allow sufficient time for new rules to be implemented so that compliance programs can effectively (a) 
assess their impact on the business; (b) design and implement policies, procedures and controls; (c) 
develop and deploy necessary supporting operations and technologies; and (d) train staff. 
•  Continue the practice of reviewing for “good faith efforts” during early examinations of rule 

implementation. This approach allows firms to be able to implement initial policies and procedures 
prior to the effective date while allowing them to evolve and enhance their compliance programs as 
necessary. 

4.  Understand and avoid unintended consequences and overlapping regulations. 

•  Coordinate rule requirements across regulators to align similar requirements (e.g., Reg BI, fiduciary 

standard of care, DOL PTE 2020-02, anti-money laundering, gifts and gratuities, etc.) 

•  Reconcile overlapping, duplicative and competing rules. 
•  Strongly consider the use of safe harbors in situations where a regulated entity may be subject to 
similar requirements across multiple regulators. For example, a broker-dealer complying with 
Regulation Best Interest could have a safe harbor from the DOL’s PTE 2020-02’s impartial conduct 
requirements. 

2 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
5.  Ensure that the analysis of the costs and benefits fully and realistically capture costs associated with 

compliance with the proposed rule.   
•  The analysis of the cost of a new rule should incorporate early input from impacted industry 

practitioners including compliance professionals to ensure that it captures all of the costs associated 
with complying with the rule. 

•  When considering the cost of complying with a proposed rule, consideration should be given to the 
fact that the proposed rule comes on top of a considerable number of requirements that are already 
in place. Costs should be assessed both in the context of the rule itself and in the context of the overall 
ruleset for which the compliance program is responsible.1 

•  After new rules are implemented, regulators should seek feedback from the industry on the actual 

• 

costs incurred to identify opportunities to enhance the cost analysis process and assess how accurate 
cost estimates were. This information could be compiled by industry groups such as NSPC. 
In considering the benefits of a proposed rule, strong consideration should be given to whether 
current rules and/or practices may already be addressing the identified objectives. For example, on 
December 21, 2022, NSCP provided comments to the SEC’s proposal related to “Outsourcing by 
Investment Advisers” noting that an NSCP survey found only rare service provider failure and no 
material impact on investors, suggesting that the existing obligations were likely sufficient to address 
the noted concerns. 

6.  Ensure liability is assigned appropriately. 

•  Where possible, design rules in a way that assigns responsibility, accountability, and liability to the 

appropriate business line parties.  

•  Where possible, design rules so that it is clear that any liability for compliance professionals follows 

the framework outlined in the NSCP’s Firm and CCO Liability Framework. 

•  Consider identifying opportunities to encourage a greater partnership with industry compliance 

professionals. Fear of personal and professional liability could discourage compliance professionals 
from openly partnering and sharing information with regulators. 

1  NSCP has developed a Broker-Dealer/Investment Advisor Mapping Tool that provides a comprehensive listing of 
rules and requirements that compliance professionals at broker-dealers and investment advisors are required to oversee.

Comment on FINRA Regulatory Notice 25-04: Broad Review to Modernize Rules 

Dear Ms. Mitchell, 

As the founder and principal of one of the only woman-owned broker-dealers in the United States, I 
welcome  the  opportunity  to  comment  on  FINRA  Regulatory  Notice  25-04.    Tobin  &  Company 
Securities is a boutique broker dealer that has served issuers and sponsors and safeguarded investors with 
uncompromising diligence and deep regulatory engagement. I submit the following comments, on six 
different topics, with the hope that we can, together, modernize and strengthen the industry through 
thoughtful, pragmatic reform. 

1. Gifts and Gratuities Rule Must Reflect Modern Business Standards 

FINRA Rule 3220 is outdated. The $100 limit - first established all the way back in 1992 when the SEC 
approved an increase from $50 - fails to account for inflation, cost of living, or modern business practices. 
FINRA  acknowledged  the  need  to  revisit  this  standard  in  Regulatory  Notice  14‑15,  published 
April 8, 2014, and again in Regulatory Notice 16‑29 in 2016. Despite those public signals, no action has 
been taken. 

Firms  remain  in  regulatory  limbo,  expected  to  adhere  to  a  dollar  ceiling  that  is  inconsistent  with  the 
realities of relationship-based business development. A modernized rule, indexed to inflation or reviewed 
regularly, would eliminate ambiguity and better serve its original purpose: to prevent improper influence, 
not penalize routine, modest business hospitality that any rational investor would expect.

2. Redundant Complaint Filings for Arbitration Are Inefficient and Illogical 

Under  current  rules,  firms  must  file  a  separate  complaint  under  FINRA  Rule  4530  when  a  FINRA-
administered  arbitration  is  initiated.  This  requirement  is  redundant  and  irrational.  FINRA  already 
possesses the full record in its role as administrator. 

Duplicative reporting serves no supervisory purpose and reflects regulatory bloat rather than necessity. 
Rule 4530 should be revised to exempt any arbitration already administered by FINRA from redundant 
complaint filings. The current practice adds friction, wastes time, and provides no benefit to investor 
protection or regulatory oversight. 

3. Advertising Review Requires Consistency - LLR Models Could Help 

Firms experience inconsistent application of FINRA Rule 2210, with interpretations often varying by 
analyst. Some communications are cleared with minimal edits, while others - nearly identical in substance 
- receive contradictory feedback. This unpredictability erodes firms’ ability to build robust compliance 
infrastructure and frustrates the very goal of protecting investors. 

FINRA  should  adopt  Large  Language  Models  (LLMs)  to  help  standardize  baseline  interpretations—
especially  for  routine  submissions.  While  human  oversight  must  remain,  AI-supported  review  could 
promote  fairness,  increase  processing  speed,  and  reduce  the  growing  disconnect  between  regulatory 
theory and practice. 

4. Enforcement Must Be Rationalized to Ensure Fairness 

FINRA  enforcement  can  appear  erratic,  opaque,  and,  at  times,  inequitable.  The  same  infraction  may 
result in dramatically different outcomes depending on the examiner, region, or even the perceived profile 
of the firm. More troublingly, the burden of enforcement often falls more heavily on firms led by women 
and people of color—despite comparable facts and circumstances. The perception is widespread, and in 
many cases, deeply rooted in lived experience. 

Equally concerning is FINRA Enforcement’s apparent resistance to transparency and responsiveness. 
We  have  been  told—directly—that  firms  are  not  entitled  to  transcripts  of  their  own  On-the-Record 
(OTR) interviews. If that is untrue—and it appears to be—why is it communicated with such certainty? 
And  if  transcripts  are  accessible,  why  is  that  information  not  provided  automatically,  as  a  matter  of 
fairness and due process? These omissions erode trust and suggest an enforcement culture more invested 
in control than clarity. 

Even basic responsiveness has become elusive in FINRA Enforcement. Over the past six months, our 
firm  requested  FINRA  Enforcement’s  input  on  a  matter  of  significance.  We  were  ignored—without 
acknowledgment, without engagement—until last week, when I escalated the matter through the chain 
of command. That is not oversight; that is institutional silence. It is corrosive. 

2 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
FINRA has the tools and institutional weight to lead by example. Carefully deployed algorithmic audits 
could identify enforcement disparities and impose greater objectivity on examination outcomes. Most 
importantly, FINRA must establish a baseline expectation that communication with member firms—
especially in matters involving reputational or legal risk—be timely, transparent, and fair. Enforcement 
should not feel arbitrary. It should feel principled, consistent, and evenhanded. 

5. Projections Should Be Permissible for Institutional and Accredited Retail Investors 

Currently,  FINRA  Rule  2210(d)(1)(F)  expressly  prohibits  any  communication  that  “predict[es]  or 
project[s]  performance,  imply[s]  that  past  performance  will  recur  or  make  any  exaggerated  or 
unwarranted claim, opinion or forecast”. The rule allows few narrow exceptions—such as hypothetical 
illustrations  of  mathematical  principles,  certain  investment  analysis  tools  under  Rule 2214,  and  price 
targets in research reports. 

This blanket prohibition is no longer appropriate. Institutional and accredited retail investors expect—
and can analyze—financial models detailing underwriting assumptions, revenue projections, capital stack 
outcomes, and stress scenarios. Prohibiting disclosure handicaps broker-dealers and their issuer clients 
and creates an uneven playing field, especially when issuers who chose not to deploy broker-dealers in 
their offerings face no such constraints. 

While FINRA has signaled on multiple occasions that it would revisit this prohibition, no formal changes 
have been made. In the meantime, firms operate under unclear, inconsistent guidance, often relying on 
analyst discretion or informal back-channel approvals. 

Crucially, Rule 2210 already governs against misleading or unsubstantiated statements. We propose that: 
o  Projections  -  along  with  reasonable  basis  analysis,  transparent  assumptions,  and  clarifying 
disclaimers - be permitted in materials directed to institutional and accredited retail audiences; 
o  FINRA  formalize  guidance  allowing  these  disclosures  under  a  defined  “projection-eligible” 

framework, aligned with the SEC’s current marketing rule; and 

o  Broker-dealers  be  held  accountable  for  the  validity  of  any  disclosed  projections,  through 

supervisory review and recordkeeping requirements. 

This update would reconcile FINRA with the realities of today’s capital-raising environment, enhance 
transparency, and remain faithful to investor protection through principle-based regulation. 

6. Insurance Accessibility and FINRA’s Opportunity for Leadership 

E&O  insurance  is  a  structural  blind  spot  in  our  industry  -  and  a  daily  source  of  stress  for  small  and 
independent  firms.  Coverage  is  often  exorbitantly  priced,  inconsistently  available,  and  written  with 
exclusions that render it useless in real-world scenarios. I know this firsthand. So do my peers. So do 
hundreds of small firm principals who would gladly pay for protection they can trust, but simply can't 
find it. 

3 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
By  contrast,  the  architecture  profession  offers  a  compelling  example  of  institutional  leadership.  The 
American Institute of Architects (AIA), together with AIA Trust, has provided clear expectations and 
consistent guidance to its members. As a result, architects enjoy wide access to meaningful, affordable 
coverage. Insurance is not feared - it is foundational. 

FINRA has an opportunity here - not to impose mandates, but to lead. It should convene stakeholders, 
promote model coverage standards, and engage with underwriters to create space for firms of all sizes to 
secure real protection. Investor confidence is strengthened when firms are covered. Our industry's health 
overwhelming depends on making that possible. 

Conclusion 

These proposed reforms reflect lived experience, not theory. They are grounded in operational necessity 
and  an  unwavering  commitment  to  investor  protection.  I  urge  FINRA  to  approach  these  areas  with 
seriousness and resolve. The industry deserves regulatory leadership that is principled, logical, modern, 
and fair.

Re:  

Regulatory Notice 25-04 (FINRA Launches Broad Review to Modernize Rules Regarding 
Member Firms and Associated Persons) 

Dear Ms. Mitchell: 

Robinhood Financial LLC and Robinhood Securities, LLC1 (together, “Robinhood”) are broker-dealers 
registered with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) and are members of the Financial 
Industry Regulatory Authority, Inc. (“FINRA”).  Robinhood respectfully submits this letter in response to 
the above-referenced request by FINRA for comment on modernizing the regulatory requirements 
applicable to FINRA member firms and their associated persons.2   

FINRA’s request is a breath of fresh air.  Many of FINRA’s rules are based on implicit premises that no 
longer hold.  The variation in business models among FINRA members is far wider than it was when 
many of the rules were drafted (in many cases decades ago).  Business practices that were once 
universal—such as charging customers commissions for trades and providing products and services over 
the phone or in brick-and-mortar locations—no longer are.  Fractional or notional trading of shares, the 
elimination of minimum charges, and the ability to invest and trade on mobile devices have dramatically 
reduced barriers to entry.  In sum, the modernization of FINRA’s rules is long overdue, so we welcome 
this initiative as a key step towards a more rational framework for regulation. 

Robinhood was founded on the principle that increased participation in the market by more investors is a 
good thing for all.  Robinhood is proud that as a result of its innovation and technology, first-time and 
other retail investors are able to participate in the U.S. markets and join in the wealth creation that 
institutional and high-net-worth investors have taken advantage of for decades.  Robinhood’s mission is to 
democratize finance for all by providing access to investing regardless of a customer’s income or wealth.  
Using technology to open the markets to retail investors from all backgrounds and remove traditional 
barriers to investing is central to our mission, and we have made investing and trading more accessible to 
many investors by eliminating account minimums and trading commissions and offering fractional 
trading.3

In accordance with the instructions in Regulatory Notice 25-04, Robinhood is not commenting in this letter 
on FINRA’s rules regarding capital formation and the modern workplace. 

In recent years there has been a significant increase in the number of new investors participating in the 
securities markets.  See, e.g., FINRA Investor Education Foundation, The Changing Landscape of Investors

It is imperative that FINRA act quickly to modernize its rules.  FINRA has moved slowly and failed to act 
on previous retrospective rule reviews4 in spite of broad consensus within the industry about a number of 
common-sense reforms.  The costs of FINRA’s outdated rules are immense and continue to impact 
FINRA members and investors every day that they remain in place.       

I. 

Costs of Outdated Rules   

We emphasize that outdated and unduly burdensome rules have significant negative impacts that go well 
beyond the direct costs of complying with such rules.  Outdated rules: 

●  Diminish investor protection and the integrity of the markets by requiring broker-dealers to 

allocate finite resources to compliance with unnecessary and ineffective regulatory requirements;  

● 

Inhibit innovation by increasing the cost and slowing the pace of product development, and 
making many products and innovations infeasible; 

●  Decrease access to the securities markets by making it more difficult for firms to utilize 

alternative business models or service retail customers, particularly retail customers with small 
accounts; 

●  Prevent members from being able to effectively communicate with their customers, which 

impedes investors’ access to useful information;   

●  Stifle competition, as complex rules favor larger and more established firms with the resources 

and economies of scale needed to comply with such rules;  

●  Drive talented professionals (particularly technology professionals, who can easily work in other 

industries and are desperately needed at many firms) away from the industry through 
unnecessarily burdensome and invasive compliance requirements and the threat of enforcement 
actions; and 

●  Diminish the competitiveness of brokerage firms as compared to firms providing similar products 
and services (e.g., investment advisers and banks), and in some cases drive investors towards 
unregulated and risky financial service providers.

II. 

Guiding Principles for Modernization   

Before describing our specific recommendations for modernization of the FINRA rules, we set forth 
several principles that we believe should guide FINRA’s approach to that process: 

●  FINRA’s rules should establish clear and easily understandable standards of conduct.  If a FINRA 
rule is so Delphic that it immediately invites varying understandings or interpretations, or is too 
complex for a firm’s employees and customers to understand, the rule is not doing its job.   

●  Rules should not be one-size-fits-all and should take into account the wide range of business 

models among FINRA members.  Rules that are designed to address specific types of activities or 
business models (e.g., advice-based brokerage) should be narrowly drafted so that they do not 
impose burdensome requirements on other activities or business models (e.g., self-directed 
brokerage) that don’t implicate the same risks.  For example, rules can be drafted on an “if . . . 
then” basis: “If a member is charging a commission to a retail customer, then . . . .”.     

●  FINRA should take a fresh look at all of its rules and be open-minded about simplifying and 

clarifying all of its rules, and about speaking to today’s members and customers in understandable 
terms.  No rule or provision should be considered sacrosanct simply because it has been in place 
for decades.  Legacy language that is outdated, or that never had a clear meaning to begin with, 
serves no purpose and should be eliminated or clarified.       

●  FINRA should carefully weigh the benefits of each rule against the direct and indirect costs of 

complying with the rule and revisit that analysis on a regular basis.  

●  FINRA should eliminate rules and reporting requirements that are duplicative of, or that overlap 
with, SEC rules.  There is no need for FINRA to regulate matters that are already effectively 
overseen by the SEC, adding needless cost and complexity.  

●  FINRA should approach the review of its rules with an awareness of, and sensitivity to, modern 

customer behaviors and preferences, including how customers and firms use technology.  While it 
may be appropriate for FINRA’s rules to be technology-neutral, they should also be created and 
updated with an understanding of the ways in which customers and firms use technology, 
including mobile devices and artificial intelligence (“AI”).   

●  The application and enforcement of FINRA rules should be straightforward, consistent and 

transparent.   

III. 

Recommendations for Modernization 

Robinhood believes that FINRA should take a broad approach in looking for opportunities to modernize 
its rules.  Below we identify some areas that are ripe for modernization and suggest how the rules 
governing those areas could better serve the purposes for which they are intended.  We have not attempted 
to catalogue all of the FINRA rules that should be changed, and we look forward to engaging with FINRA 
in more detail in connection with this project and future rule reviews and proposals. 

A. 

Communications with Investors 

Brokerage firms exist to meet their customers’ needs.  Customers want tools to analyze, buy, and sell in 
their own time and on their own terms.  They also want access to, and reliable information about, the 

Docusign Envelope ID: 49B8EFCE-EC6D-4249-8593-644DA37471DD 
Jennifer Piorko Mitchell

Page 4 

cutting edge of the financial markets.  In order to serve those needs, Robinhood has to move quickly, 
engage with investors through all modern forms of media, and provide investors with access to the 
information necessary to understand new markets and other financial innovations and to make intelligent 
decisions about them.  In an age when the information cycle is measured in minutes or even seconds, 
rules created for a weekly or monthly cycle of advertisements in print magazines can hinder as easily as 
they can help.  Investors have access to many other sources of information, and if brokers are unable to 
keep up because of overly burdensome compliance requirements, then investors will simply go elsewhere 
for their information, which may include unregulated, conflicted, and otherwise unreliable sources of 
information.  FINRA should update its marketing and customer communication rules to meet modern 
realities:   

●  Disclosure practices.  FINRA should amend Rule 2210 to allow firms to make disclosures in a 

manner that befits the communication subject to the disclosure.  In Regulatory Notice 19-31 and 
its related FAQs, FINRA welcomed innovative design techniques and provided some relief from 
restrictive disclosure requirements,5 but we believe that this guidance is inadequate to address 
modern customers’ demands for timely and rapidly updated communications delivered to their 
mobile devices.  In communications presented through mobile devices, it is cumbersome and 
often impractical to provide investors with the lengthy written disclosures that have traditionally 
accompanied written marketing materials—and highly questionable whether those disclosures are 
serving their intended functions.  In spite of existing guidance, there are ongoing concerns about 
whether hyperlinked or layered disclosures can satisfy requirements or expectations regarding the 
prominence or proximity of disclosures.  We recommend that FINRA explicitly recognize that 
disclosures included within a sufficiently prominent hyperlink or similar feature (e.g., a pop-up) 
can satisfy prominence and/or proximity requirements.  It would also be helpful for FINRA to 
allow—or even provide models of—simplified disclosures that more accessibly deliver customers 
the essential points that the lengthier, legacy disclosures were originally designed to convey. 

o  Similar issues can arise under SEC rules that include prominence and proximity requirements 
for disclosures.  We request that FINRA coordinate and work closely with the SEC to provide 
guidance that would similarly modernize the SEC’s approach to today’s advertising practices 
and layered disclosure.6   

●  Harmonization.  FINRA should work with the SEC to harmonize FINRA Rule 2210 with Rule 
206(4)-1 under the Investment Advisers Act of 1940, which governs marketing materials issued 
by investment advisers (the “IA Marketing Rule”).  While the amendment to Rule 2210 that 
FINRA adopted in 20247 included some welcome steps towards harmonization, it fell short of full

https://www.finra.org/rules-guidance/guidance/faqs/advertising-regulation.   

The SEC has already recognized the appropriateness of layered disclosure in a number of contexts.  See, 
e.g., Tailored Shareholder Reports for Mutual Funds and Exchange-Traded Funds; Fee Information in 
Investment Company Advertisements, 87 Fed. Reg. 72758 at n. 40 (“This feedback generally showed that 
retail investors prefer concise, layered disclosure and feel overwhelmed by the volume of information they 
currently receive, with some individual investors specifically addressing and supporting a more concise, 
summary shareholder report.”); Staff Statement Regarding Form CRS Disclosures (Dec. 17, 2021), 
https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/staff-statement-form-crs-disclosures-121721 (“This 
allows firms to summarize this information while making available more detailed information for retail 
investors through layered disclosure.”).

harmonization with the IA Marketing Rule and was withdrawn by the SEC.8  Because of the 
greater flexibility provided by the IA Marketing Rule with respect to certain types of performance 
information, broker-dealers and investment advisers are competing on an unequal playing field 
when advertising their services to investors.        

●  Recommendations.  FINRA should also work with the SEC to modernize the definition of a 

“recommendation” for purposes of FINRA’s suitability rule (Rule 2111) and SEC Regulation Best 
Interest.9  Decades-old guidance from the National Association of Securities Dealers (“NASD”) 
suggests that merely sending a communication to a group of customers could, in some 
circumstances, constitute a recommendation.10  That guidance is terminally outdated, particularly 
with respect to self-directed brokers who make clear to investors that they do not provide 
recommendations.  No reasonable customer of a self-directed firm would view a broadly 
disseminated communication from such a self-directed broker to be a recommendation.  
Moreover, the purpose of the recommendation-related rules is to manage the conflicts of interest 
that arise when a broker-dealer earns a commission on a transaction or stands to benefit from a 
customer’s purchase of one security to the exclusion of another—concerns not relevant in the 
modern self-directed brokerage space.  Self-directed broker-dealers should be able to empower 
investors and provide information without risk of transforming that information into a 
recommendation.   

●  Principal approval.  Firms need to be nimble in their communications with investors, including 
retail investors, especially in today’s fast-moving marketplace.  We believe that firms can 
effectively supervise lower-risk retail communications without requiring that every retail 
communication be approved by a registered principal (as is currently required by Rule 
2210(b)(1)).  There is currently an exception from the preapproval requirement in Rule 
2210(b)(1)(D)(iii) for “any retail communication that does not make any financial or investment 
recommendation or otherwise promote a product or service of the member.”  We believe that it 
would be appropriate for that exception to simply apply to “any retail communication that does 
not make any financial or investment recommendation,” provided that a principal is still 
responsible for supervising any such communication (e.g., in the same manner as institutional 
communications under FINRA Rule 2210(b)(3)).  We note that, in light of significant 
advancements in AI, it may be possible for firms to develop AI systems that can empower 
principals to efficiently and effectively supervise such retail communications without the 
principal needing to separately review each communication in advance. 

●  Consistent application of FINRA Rule 2210.  Many of the content standards in FINRA Rule 

2210(d), such as the fair and balanced standard, are subjective and involve nuanced judgment

calls when applying them in practice.  We have concerns that Rule 2210 has not been enforced by 
FINRA in a consistent and equitable manner.  Individual staff within FINRA’s Advertising 
Regulation Department (“Ad Reg”) have significant discretion to provide feedback on firms’ 
communications, including communications that are not required to be filed with Ad Reg, that 
can hinder firms’ communications and marketing strategies.  If Rule 2210 is functioning properly, 
one member should not be prohibited from using a certain type of content while other members 
openly use such content.  In order to ensure that FINRA Rule 2210 functions properly, FINRA 
should implement organizational and procedural safeguards that promote consistent feedback 
from Ad Reg staff and provide members with clear recourse when they believe that the rule is 
being improperly interpreted or inconsistently enforced.11      

B. 

Membership, Registered Representative and Associated Persons 

The rules, requirements, and processes around continuing membership applications (“CMAs”), Forms U4 
and U5, and the registration of representatives present a number of opportunities for modernization: 

●  CMA Process.  The requirements of Rule 1017 and related rules create significant costs for 
FINRA members.  The CMA process itself can require significant expenditures of time and 
resources, but just as significantly, the CMA process creates uncertainty and delays around 
business changes that can inhibit innovation.  Similarly, the requirement to file a CMA in 
connection with ownership changes and mergers and acquisition transactions adds uncertainty to 
such transactions that can materially impact the enterprise value of a broker-dealer.  We 
recommend that FINRA implement broad changes to FINRA Rule 1017 and related rules and the 
CMA process to allow lower-risk business and ownership changes to proceed more quickly and 
with less uncertainty.12  FINRA should adopt clear exemptions from the CMA requirements for 
certain low-risk business and ownership changes and merger and acquisition transactions.  
FINRA should also provide greater transparency around eligibility for the Fast Track review 
process, dedicate more resources to that program, and allow more CMAs to be eligible for Fast 
Track review.             

●  Form U4.  The current version of the Uniform Application for Securities Industry Registration or 
Transfer (“Form U4”) has been in place without any substantive changes for over 15 years.13  We 
recommend that FINRA coordinate with the SEC and the states to review the entire Form U4 and 
study whether changes should be made to modernize the form.  Of particular importance, we 
suggest that regulators consider eliminating, narrowing or otherwise modifying the Disclosure 
Questions in Item 14 to make the form more user-friendly and ensure that the information 
required in the form is reasonably necessary to protect investors.  Specifically:   

11  

12  

13  

FINRA should consider moving Ad Reg from within the Office of the Chief Legal Officer to the Member 
Supervision Group.  This change could help ensure better coordination between Ad Reg and exam teams.  

We note that the exception in FINRA Rule 1017(c)(1) that allows a member to effect a change of control 30 
days after filing a CMA is inadequate, as most buyers and investors are unwilling to accept the risk of 
FINRA imposing interim restrictions or denying the application after the change of control has been 
effected.      

Forms U4 and U5 were last amended in May 2009.  See Self-Regulatory Organizations; Financial Industry 
Regulatory Authority, Inc. and Order Approving a Proposed Rule Change as Modified by Amendment No.

Item 14A(1), which currently asks whether a person has ever (i.e., with no time limitation) 
been convicted of or charged with a felony, should be changed to (i) incorporate a limited 
look-back period of 10 years for convictions for felonies other than financial crimes and (ii) 
eliminate reporting of felony charges that have been dismissed or are otherwise no longer 
pending.  The collection of information regarding felony convictions that are older than 10 
years and felony charges is not necessary for statutory disqualification determinations and can 
have a discriminatory impact without providing any meaningful protection to investors.14   

Item 14I can require reporting of pending arbitration or litigation matters that have no merit 
or reporting with respect to a complaint against a registered representative who had 
absolutely no involvement in the relevant matter simply because a customer named them in 
their complaint.  This item should be narrowed significantly to exclude pending matters and 
allow the exclusion of registered representatives who are reasonably determined to have no 
involvement in the relevant complaint.    

●  Form U5.  Like Form U4, the Uniform Termination Notice for Securities Industry Registration 
(“Form U5”) has not changed substantively in over 15 years.15  Again, Robinhood suggests that 
FINRA, the SEC and states conduct a wholesale review of the efficacy of Form U5.  One area of 
specific focus should be the approach to the collection of information regarding the termination of 
registered representatives on Form U5.  Currently, the requirements of Form U5 create a 
high-stakes scenario any time a registered representative is terminated for any reason other than 
“voluntary.”  Firms spend time, effort and resources to ensure that the information that they 
provide on Form U5 is accurate but also not defamatory towards the registered representative.  
We encourage regulators to implement changes to Form U5 and related rules so that they continue 
to receive information regarding terminations that implicate material risks to customers and 
FINRA members, while limiting the costs and unintended consequences for ordinary course 
terminations.  Alternatively, the SEC could issue regulations preempting any private claim for 
damages arising from a Form U5 disclosure. 

●  Registered representatives and associated persons.  FINRA’s rules and guidance and the scope of 

registered representative and associated person status have not kept pace with evolving 
technology and broker-dealers’ business models and operations.  There is a sufficient lack of 
clarity as to when a person is “engaged in the investment banking or securities business of a 
member” and required to be a registered representative pursuant to FINRA Rule 1210 or whether 
the person’s functions are “solely and exclusively clerical or ministerial” and exempt from 
registration pursuant to FINRA Rule 1230.  There is a similar lack of clarity with respect to the 
definition of an “associated person of a member” under Article I(rr) of FINRA’s Bylaws.  The 
lack of guidance, combined with aggressive enforcement by FINRA’s Department of 
Enforcement, has resulted in firms having to register or associate substantial numbers of 
personnel who have very limited substantive involvement with their broker-dealer businesses, and 
undertaking all of the significant compliance burdens associated with registered representative or 
associated person status with respect to such personnel (e.g., outside business activity and private 
securities transaction reviews, communication surveillance, gift and entertainment reviews,

securities account reviews).  This issue is particularly acute at financial services firms with 
significant non-broker–dealer business, who often must prophylactically register or associate 
significant numbers of employees (particularly technology and other back-office personnel, who 
can number in the hundreds or thousands at larger firms) who have minor or tangential 
connection to the firm’s broker-dealer business, because of the threat of enforcement.  We 
strongly urge FINRA to issue updated registered representative and associated person definitions 
or interpretations that reflect the structure of modern broker-dealers and that include clear and 
meaningful exemptions for personnel with limited roles and that pose low risks to members and 
their customers.  We understand that these issues overlap substantially with the fingerprinting 
requirements in Rule 17f-2 under the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934 (the “Exchange Act”), 
so we encourage FINRA to work collaboratively with the SEC to similarly modernize Rule 17f-2.           

●  Permissive Registration.  FINRA should provide further guidance on Supplementary Material .02 
to FINRA Rule 1210 regarding permissive licenses and when a firm may maintain an individual’s 
registration.      

C. 

Supervision 

Broker-dealers have extensive obligations to supervise their associated persons and business activities.  
Because of the importance of effective supervision, it is critical that FINRA rules do not require member 
firms to expend resources on supervisory activities that do not provide meaningful protections to investors 
or the markets.  We have several suggestions for how FINRA could modernize various supervisory rules 
to make them more efficient and targeted to material risks: 

●  Gifts.  The current restrictions and recordkeeping requirements around gifts16 have been a huge 
administrative burden for FINRA members without any clear benefit.  There is no evidence of 
widespread misconduct or risk involving the small gifts that are regulated by the current rules.  As 
any broker-dealer compliance officer can attest, countless hours have been wasted on dealing with 
harmless and well-meaning gifts, particularly around the end-of-year holidays.  We recommend 
that FINRA substantially increase the current $100 limit on gifts in the FINRA rules (which has 
been in place for over 30 years)17 to $500 to not only take into account historical inflation, but to 
also provide a cushion for future inflation and reflect the overall low risk of gifts.  Additionally, 
FINRA should set a clear threshold of $100 for gifts of a de minimis value and promotional items 
displaying a firm’s logo that are excluded from the recordkeeping and aggregation requirements 
of the gift rule.18  To the extent that any FINRA member has concerns about the risk of gifts 

16  

17  

18  

FINRA Rule 3220 regulates gifts generally, and FINRA Rules 2310 (Direct Participation Programs), 2320 
(Variable Contracts of an Insurance Company), 2341 (Investment Company Securities), and 5110 
(Corporate Financing Rule – Underwriting Terms and Arrangements) effectively incorporate the limit on 
gifts in Rule 3220 in connection with the sale and distribution of securities covered by those rules. 

See Order Approving File No. SR-NASD-92-40, Exchange Act Release No. 31662 (Dec. 28, 1992).  
Although FINRA recently submitted a proposed rule change to the SEC that would increase the gift limit 
from $100 to $250 per person per year, Robinhood believes that $250 is still too low and continues 
burdensome tracking and reporting without benefit.  See Proposed Rule Change to Amend Rule 3220 
(Influencing or Rewarding Employees of others), SR 2025-003 (May 29, 2025) (“Proposed Gift Rule 
Amendment”).   

Currently, FINRA guidance provides an exemption from recordkeeping requirements for promotional items 
whose value is substantially below the current $100 limit.  See NASD Notice to Members 06-69 (Dec. 
2006).  The Proposed Gift Rule Amendment would retain the same “substantially below” standard, which 
we believe is unnecessarily vague.  If the rule includes a specific dollar amount for the maximum annual

Jennifer Piorko Mitchell

Page 9 

within their own business model, they will be free to implement policies and procedures with 
stricter requirements. 

●  Employee securities accounts.  Another burdensome and outdated rule that firms continuously 
struggle with is FINRA Rule 3110(d)(1), which requires members to review transactions in 
associated persons’ personal and family securities accounts.  While the general intention behind 
this requirement is valid, the rule is overbroad and imposes significant compliance burdens that 
are not justified with respect to many firms and employees.  Firms and their employees spend 
inordinate amounts of time (time that increases exponentially as a result of the overbroad scope of 
the associated person definition, as discussed in Section III.B above): (i) cataloguing employees’ 
securities accounts and those of their family members, (ii) establishing electronic brokerage feeds 
from other broker-dealers, and troubleshooting issues that arise with those feeds, (iii) collecting 
paper account statements when an electronic brokerage feed is unavailable, (iv) training 
employees on the requirements regarding securities accounts, which often involve nuanced and 
complicated distinctions between different types of accounts and family relationships, and (v) 
reviewing voluminous trading data,19 among other tasks.  All of this time and effort is spent in 
spite of the fact that many firms’ business models do not involve activities that implicate the 
concerns of Rule 3110(d)(1).  There are also many firms where only a small number of 
employees have roles or access to information that implicate meaningful risk.  We urge FINRA to 
implement clear and meaningful exemptions from the requirements of FINRA Rule 3110(d)(1) 
for lower-risk firms or with respect to lower-risk associated persons.           

D. 

Regulatory Reporting 

FINRA members are currently required to report numerous types of data to FINRA (and other regulators 
and self-regulatory organizations).  These reporting requirements would benefit from updates that 
eliminate unnecessary or duplicative information.  

●  Duplicative or extraneous reporting.  FINRA should not require submission of data that is not 

actually being used.  Firms are required to provide data to various regulatory systems, including, 
but not limited to, the Consolidated Audit Trail, the Trade Reporting and Compliance Engine, and 
the Trade Reporting Facility, and must submit reports such as the Financial and Operational 
Combined Uniform Single report, electronic blue sheets, and short interest position reports.  
FINRA has proposed a new facility, the Securities Lending and Transparency Engine (“SLATE”), 
to report covered securities loan transactions.  Some of the data collected in these systems or 
through these reports is of unclear value or duplicative of other data collected.  For example, 
FINRA Rule 4560 requires short interest position reporting.  Because firms report that data twice 
a month, there is little, if any, utility to it in today’s fast-moving markets.  As such, Robinhood 
suggests that such reports be eliminated or included in SLATE reporting.  More generally, FINRA 
should thoroughly review its usage of the information provided pursuant to various reporting 
rules and eliminate reporting requirements that are not providing FINRA with data that is actually 
being used in practice.   

value of gifts, there is no reason that it cannot also include a specific dollar amount for the de minimis 
threshold.  In 2016, FINRA proposed a specific de minimis threshold of $50.  See Regulatory Notice 16-29 
(Aug. 8, 2016).         

19  

In most cases, the burden of these reviews is magnified by the fact that the person reviewing the activity in 
an employee’s account has no meaningful basis for determining whether a trade or series of trades in an 
account “may violate the provisions of the Exchange Act.”

Five years ago, FINRA initiated a retrospective review of Rule 4530 and collected comments, but the 
exercise did not result in any changes to the rule.20  As such, FINRA already has received extensive 
feedback as to the effectiveness and efficiency of Rule 4530.  Robinhood also has a number of specific 
recommendations for modernization of the requirements of Rule 4530: 

●  FINRA Rule 4530(d).  Rule 4530(d) requires FINRA members to provide quarterly reports to 

FINRA on written complaints.  The rule, as currently structured and interpreted, may have made 
sense many years ago when the primary form of a written complaint was a letter mailed by a 
customer.  However, modern technology has made it much easier for investors to communicate 
with brokers.  Robinhood, of course, welcomes easier communication with investors and wants 
to hear about how to make customers’ user experience on Robinhood better, but this has become 
problematic in the context of Rule 4530(d) when nearly any form of feedback from a customer 
(or a person purporting to be customer) can constitute a “complaint” that must be analyzed and 
processed under Rule 4530(d).21  Because of how broadly “complaint” has been defined and 
interpreted by FINRA, Rule 4530(d) can require firms to gather and report voluminous and 
immaterial information to FINRA.  Rule 4530(d) should not require reporting of all feedback 
from customers, regardless of merit or materiality.  We recommend that FINRA limit Rule 
4530(d) reporting to “complaints that warrant a response.”  This would be a similar approach 
taken by Australian regulators, which define a complaint as an “expression of dissatisfaction 
made to or about an organisation, related to its products, services, staff or the handling of a 
complaint, where a response or resolution is explicitly or implicitly expected or legally 
required.”22  Additionally, FINRA has previously provided guidance indicating that tweets and 
similar messages received from customers can be reportable under Rule 4530(d).  As a general 
matter, Robinhood (and we expect most firms) does not have any reliable means of determining 
whether communications received though public social media channels, such as comments, video 
chats, and other social media posts, are being sent by an actual customer (or even a real person), 
and combing through such social media channels for the purposes of identifying complaints can 
be an extremely burdensome and impractical exercise.  We recommend that FINRA narrow Rule 
4530(d) reporting to complaints received through a channel or in a manner through which a firm 
can reasonably authenticate the identity of the person providing the complaint, such as a specific 
intake location.  Ultimately, the purpose of Rule 4530(d) should be to inform FINRA of potential 
customer harm.  In practice, the rule has created an endless paper chase that has detracted from 
firms’ ability to efficiently respond to customer feedback because of the time they must spend 
applying the requirements of Rule 4530(d) to immaterial and in some cases fictitious 
“complaints.”    

●  FINRA Rule 4530(a)(1)(B).  Rule 4530(a)(1)(B) requires a firm to report if it is the subject of any 

written customer complaint involving allegations of theft or misappropriation of funds or 
securities or of forgery.  While we agree that FINRA has a valid interest in being informed of any 
such activity, in practice customers can submit complaints regarding this type of activity that are 
completely without merit.  Thus, we propose that this rule include a carve-out from reporting of

See FINRA Requests Comments on the Effectiveness and Efficiency of Its Reporting Requirements Rule, 
Regulatory Notice 20-02 (Jan. 9, 2020).   

Another detrimental effect of Rule 4530(d) is that it discourages firms from conducting surveys or similar 
forms of outreach because of concerns that the outreach will generate feedback that must be analyzed and 
processed as a complaint under Rule 4530(d).

any complaint where a firm reasonably concludes, after appropriate investigation, that the 
complaint is without merit. 

●  FINRA Rule 4530(b).  Rule 4530(b) requires a member firm to report to FINRA when it has 
concluded or reasonably should have concluded that it or an associated person has violated 
various rules or regulations.  Rule 4530(b) should be eliminated, as it is vague, overbroad and 
otherwise fundamentally flawed in a number of respects: 

o  Rule 4530(b) was adopted in 2011 as part of the NASD/NYSE rulebook consolidation 

process and originates from former NYSE Rule 351(a)(1).23  Prior to 2011, there was no 
similar requirement applicable to NASD or FINRA members, but FINRA incorporated 
the self-reporting requirements of NYSE Rule 351(a)(1) into Rule 4530(b) without any 
significant discussion or consideration as to whether those requirements (which impose 
substantial burdens on members) are necessary or appropriate to apply to all FINRA 
members.24   Broker-dealers who trade on the NYSE have very different business models, 
risk profiles and market impact than many of the firms within the very diverse 
population of broker-dealers that comprise FINRA’s membership.25  FINRA’s mandatory 
self-reporting of internal conclusions regarding regulatory violations is relatively unique 
within U.S. financial services regulation, and imposes substantial burdens on 
broker-dealers.    

o 

In practice, Rule 4530(b) has operated primarily as a pipeline for enforcement actions, as 
reporting a matter to FINRA under Rule 4530(b) appears to automatically trigger a cause 
examination or enforcement investigation, even if other regulators, like the SEC, already 
have an open inquiry.  This contributes to an adversarial dynamic between member firms 
and FINRA, where instead of focusing on how they can correct mistakes in order to 
protect customers and the markets, members must spend more and more time evaluating 
whether matters must be reported pursuant to Rule 4530(b) and, if a matter is reported, 
respond to inevitable cause exam or enforcement investigation requests.   

o  Although the rule includes a materiality threshold for the violative conduct that triggers 
reporting,26 the standards are vague; FINRA has not defined or provided adequate

2008). 

Prior to the merger of the NYSE and NASD in 2007, there were over 5,000 NASD members, but only 
approximately 170 of them were also members of the NYSE.  See Erik R. Sirri, Testimony Concerning 
Consolidation of NASD with the Member Firm Regulatory Functions of the NYSE: Working Towards 
Improved Regulation, Before the Subcommittee on Securities, Insurance, and Investment of the U.S. Senate

FINRA Rule 4530(b), Supplementary Material .01.  When adopting the new rule in 2011 as part of the 
NYSE/NASD rulebook consolidation, FINRA noted that self-reporting should be limited to the most 
significant issues.  FINRA stated, “[w]0ith respect to violative conduct by a firm, this provision requires the 
firm to report only conduct that has widespread or potential widespread impact to the firm, its customers or 
the markets, or conduct that arises from a material failure of the firm’s systems, policies or practices 
involving numerous customers, multiple errors or significant dollar amounts.”

guidance on several key terms and concepts in the rule.  This has caused industry 
confusion as to what is required to be reported and effectively punishes firms that take a 
broader reading of the rule’s opaque standards.  Additionally, and importantly, for as 
much time as firms spend on matters that are reported pursuant to FINRA Rule 4530(b), 
they may spend as much if not more time evaluating and documenting their approach to 
matters that are not reported pursuant to Rule 4530(b) but that must nevertheless be 
evaluated because of the rule’s breadth and vagueness.  

o  Much has changed since NYSE Rule 351(a)(1) was operative.  FINRA has many more 
tools for monitoring member firms through its risk monitoring program, extensive 
cross-market trade surveillance, surveys, the Consolidated Audit Trail, and many other 
sophisticated tools and reports that have been developed and expanded over time.    

If FINRA decides that it must retain Rule 4530(b), it should be narrowed so that it is more clearly 
risk-based and requires reporting only when there is manifest harm to customers or the integrity 
of the markets.  Robinhood also recommends that FINRA publish additional guidance regarding 
the contours of the rule, including its thresholds.  Finally, FINRA should heed a long-time 
industry request that credit for self-reporting and extraordinary cooperation be tangible, reliable 
and transparent.  For example, in instances where a firm has self-reported, promptly and 
effectively addressed an issue, and provided remediation to customers, the default should be that 
the matter is closed without formal action.   

E. 

Customer Account Transfers 

FINRA should update its rules regarding automated account transfers through the industry’s Automated 
Customer Account Transfer Service (“ACATS”).     

●  Rule 11870(d)(3).  This provision provides that a firm may take exception to a transfer 

instruction only for enumerated reasons, none of which include fraud.  The rule should be 
amended to reflect FINRA’s recent regulatory guidance regarding the risks of fraudulent ACATS 
transfers and allow firms to reject an ACATS where they have concerns about fraudulent 
activity.27 

●  Rule 11870(d)(4).  This provision requires a receiving member to attach a customer statement if 
the carrying member takes exception to the ACATS because the account is “flat.”  However, 
many firms generate statements on a monthly basis, which do not necessarily include an 
up-to-date reflection of a customer’s holdings at the time of transfer.  Therefore, Rule 
11870(d)(4) should be amended to include other methods by which a receiving member can 
verify a customer’s holdings.   

F. 

Rule Alignment 

FINRA should review its rules for internally inconsistent applications and definitions.  Different scopes 
and applications between rules create confusion in the industry, as well as significant work for compliance 
departments, without aiding in the protection of customers or the improvement of market integrity.  For 
example, FINRA Rule 5310, which restricts the purchase and sale of initial public offerings by associated 
persons, contains provisions that apply to family members of the associated person, including parents, 
spouses, children, in-laws, and any other individual who the associated person supports.  In contrast, 

27  

See FINRA Regulatory Notice 22-21 (Oct. 6, 2022) and FINRA Regulatory Notice 23-06 (Mar. 28, 2023).

FINRA Rule 3210, which governs mandatory disclosure of certain accounts connected to associated 
persons, limits the family members covered by the rule to spouses and children that reside in the same 
household, or those who have accounts that the associated person controls.  FINRA should revise these 
rules to align with the approach taken by Rule 3210.  

G. 

Interpretive Guidance 

While FINRA should strive to adopt rules that are clear and unambiguous, it is inevitable that interpretive 
questions will arise due to changes in technology, business models, investment products and customer 
habits, among other factors.  We believe that FINRA should be nimble in addressing interpretive 
questions through Regulatory Notices, FAQs, interpretive letters and other forms of formal and informal 
guidance.  We understand that in some cases there are concerns that certain forms of guidance or “relief” 
could rise to the level of a rule change that would need to be filed with the SEC pursuant to Section 19(b) 
of the Exchange Act.  While we recognize the constraints imposed by Section 19(b), FINRA and the SEC 
should provide more transparency regarding what types of guidance are restricted by Section 19(b).  In 
recent years there has been a significant decrease in interpretive guidance from FINRA, and we are 
concerned that an overbroad interpretation of Section 19(b) has been used as a pretext for inaction by 
FINRA and the SEC.        

H. 

Enforcement 

Part of making clear rules is making clear the consequences for violations of the rules.  The current lack 
of visibility into the enforcement process creates confusion and uncertainty in the industry, hindering 
FINRA’s mission of promoting investor protection, market integrity, and vibrant capital markets.  While 
Robinhood believes that FINRA’s Enforcement Department needs to be fundamentally and holistically 
reformed so that it functions more effectively, efficiently, and fairly for both member firms and for the 
protection of investors, we offer several reforms below that FINRA could immediately implement to 
address some of Enforcement’s procedural and operational deficiencies.   

●  Enforcement manual.  Firms are regularly subject to enforcement investigations that cause them 
to expend a significant amount of time, money, and other resources responding to requests from 
FINRA’s Department of Enforcement, often after having already done so in connection with 
requests from Market Regulation and Transparency Services or Member Supervision.  Yet, 
member firms do not have sufficient insight into FINRA’s enforcement process—from the genesis 
of the investigation to the decision as to how the matter should be resolved.  This creates 
confusion and can give firms a sense of arbitrariness regarding the process.  FINRA should 
provide firms with visibility into its enforcement practices by publishing its Enforcement Manual, 
as do the SEC and Commodity Futures Trading Commission (“CFTC”).28 

●  Sanction Guidelines.  When FINRA levies fines, they are often significantly higher than the range 
specified in FINRA’s Sanction Guidelines.  The rationale for this is often unclear, diminishing the 
value of the Sanction Guidelines to member firms, associated persons, and the industry.  
Therefore, we recommend that FINRA enact an internal rule that requires (i) FINRA to provide 

28

https://www.sec.gov/divisions/enforce/enforcementmanual.pdf; Commodity Futures Trading Commission, 
Division of Enforcement Manual, available at 
https://www.cftc.gov/sites/default/files/2021-05/EnforcementManual.pdf.

written justification for any fine that exceeds FINRA’s sanction guidelines29 and (ii) any such fine 
to be approved by the FINRA National Adjudicatory Council.  

●  Credit for extraordinary cooperation.  Robinhood appreciates that FINRA recognizes that firms 
may be eligible to receive credit for “extraordinary cooperation” when assessing sanctions in 
enforcement actions.30  However, member firms would benefit from being given greater clarity as 
to the way in which this credit is assessed and the amount of the credit being given.  Recently, the 
CFTC’s Division of Enforcement issued an advisory that provided firms with guidance on its 
calculation of the credit for self-reporting or providing substantial assistance in an investigation.  
This guidance included a four-tier scale for the level of cooperation and a matrix quantifying the 
presumptive mitigation credit.31  Robinhood recommends that FINRA issue similar guidance to 
provide for tangible, reliable and transparent credit for extraordinary cooperation.  Further, 
FINRA should more clearly reward firms that self-report matters.  This should be the case 
whether FINRA abandons mandatory self-reporting under Rule 4530(b), as we have 
recommended, or keeps it in place.  If FINRA retains mandatory self-reporting, then in the 
absence of tangible, reliable and clear credit for self-reporting, a firm is perversely disincentivized 
from conducting robust examinations that could potentially identify compliance violations, as 
anything that they discover could be reportable under Rule 4530(b) and result in an enforcement 
action.  Similarly, even in the absence of a self-reporting requirement under Rule 4530(b), 
without clearer standards regarding the reward for doing so, firms may be hesitant to self-report.       

●  Rapid remediation review process.  Enforcement investigations and their subsequent resolutions 

are often time-consuming and expensive.  Although Robinhood recognizes that certain issues may 
warrant intervention from the Department of Enforcement, many issues, especially those relating 
to transaction reporting, would be better served through resolution outside of the enforcement 
framework.  The creation by FINRA’s Department of Market Regulation and Transparency 
Services of the Rapid Remediation review process, which allows FINRA to alert firms quickly 
and informally about potential market integrity or market conduct issues, recognizes this.  By 
providing a framework for addressing more technical transactional violations, such as discrete 
trade reporting issues, outside of the enforcement process, both FINRA and the firm can 
remediate the issue on an expedited basis, ensuring the integrity of the audit trail, without either 
the firm or the Department of Enforcement expending time and resources on these issues.  The 
Rapid Remediation review process should be expanded to encompass findings made by Member 
Supervision and codified into FINRA’s rules. 

●  Timeliness.  Investors, member firms and FINRA are best served by the timely resolution of 

enforcement investigations.  A firm that is the subject of an enforcement investigation has the 
proverbial Sword of Damocles hanging over its head, restricting its ability to run its business and 
plan for the future, and should not be left in this position indefinitely.  FINRA should set 
reasonable goals for the completion of its investigations and initiating enforcement actions, and 

29  

30  

31  

This approach would be similar to FINRA Rule 9270(c), which requires a firm that wishes to make an offer 
of settlement in a contested enforcement action to provide a settlement proposal that “is consistent with 
FINRA’s then current sanction guidelines or, if inconsistent with the sanction guidelines, a detailed 
statement supporting the proposed sanction.” 

See Regulatory Notice 19-23 (July 11, 2019).

should publish statistics on its results to make information available for scrutiny by members and 
the investing public.32    

●  Minor Rule Violations.  To the extent that the Rapid Remediation review process is not the 

appropriate mechanism to resolve discreet or minor violations of FINRA rules, FINRA should 
expand the scope and increase the maximum fine amount provided in FINRA Rules 9216(b) and 
9217 under its Minor Rule Violation Plan to address non-systemic violations or rule violations 
that did not result in customer harm.  FINRA rarely utilizes the Minor Rule Violation process, 
perhaps because the maximum fine has remained at $2,500 for many years.  Robinhood believes 
that the Minor Rule Violation Plan, if updated, would be an efficient way of resolving many 
issues that do not warrant in-depth investigations.  

●  Limitation periods.  FINRA investigations often seek information, data, and documents beyond 
the current recordkeeping obligations applicable to member firms, and investigations linger for 
years with no resolution.  FINRA should adopt limitation periods similar to those that govern 
SEC enforcement actions.33 

●  8210 Requests.  FINRA should implement procedural safeguards, such as requiring senior-level 
authorization, around the initiation of information requests pursuant to FINRA Rule 8210 to 
ensure that such requests are not being made in an inconsistent, duplicative or overzealous 
manner.34

Until Fiscal Year 2018, the SEC published its goals in this area.  See, e.g., SEC Office of Inspector General 
Report No. 576 “Enforcement Investigations: Measures of Timeliness Showed Some Improvement But 
Enforcement Can Better Communicate Capabilities for Expediting Investigations and Improve Internal 
Processes,” Feb. 15, 2023 available at 
https://www.sec.gov/files/enforcement-investigat-meas-timeliness-show-some-improvement-enforcement-c
an-better-comm.pdf (reflecting the results of goals such as the “Percentage of First Enforcement Actions 
Filed within 2 Years of the Opening of an Investigation” and “Average Months Between Opening a MUI or 
an Investigation and Commencing an Enforcement Action”). 

See, e.g., 28 U.S.C. § 2462 (five-year statute of limitations for SEC claims for civil monetary penalties); 15 
U.S.C. § 78u(d)(8)(B) (10-year statute of limitations for SEC claims for any equitable remedy, including 
for an injunction or for a bar, suspension, or cease and desist order); 15 U.S.C. § 78u(d)(8)(A)(ii) (10-year 
statute of limitations for any SEC claims for disgorgement if the conduct violates antifraud provisions or 
any other provision of the securities laws for which scienter must be established); 15 U.S.C. § 
78u(d)(8)(A)(ii) (five-year statute of limitations for SEC claims for disgorgement in matters involving other 
violations). 

Indeed, the SEC recently changed its rules to eliminate the authority of the Director of Enforcement to issue 
formal  orders  of  investigation  and  instead  vested  such  authority  in  the  Commission.  See Securities and 
Exchange Commission, Final Commission Votes for Agency Proceedings (Mar. 2025).

Re: 

FINRA Regulatory Notice 25-04 

Dear Ms. Mitchell: 

On  behalf  of  the  Alternative  &  Direct  Investment  Securities  Association  (“ADISA”)1,  we  are 
submitting this comment letter regarding the request for public comment set forth in Regulatory Notice 25-
04 (the “Notice”). The Notice contains a broad request for comments on ways to modernize FINRA rules, 
interpretations  and  guidance.  ADISA  members  include  retail  broker-dealers,  managing  broker-dealers 
(collectively “BDs”), and registered persons.  

Given  the  importance  of  the  issues  raised  in  the  Notice  to  BDs  and  other  participants  in  the 
securities industry who are ADISA members, ADISA surveyed its BD and registered person members on 
issues that they are grappling with or otherwise running into, and the results of that survey are reflected in 
the comments below. Some of the issues are relatively complex and we have tried to keep our comments 
succinct and focused; we would be glad to provide more and/or deeper analyses of the points made herein 
to  the  extent  that  FINRA  staff  would  find  that  helpful.  ADISA  appreciates  the  opportunity  to  provide 
comments on behalf of its members and wants to ensure that its input is provided in the most constructive 
manner possible. 

1.  Rule 2210 - Communication with the Public.   

a.  “First Touch” Communications with Potential New Clients.   

ADISA  requests  that  FINRA  allow  streamlined  disclosure  for  “first  touch” 
communications with potential new clients, with full Reg BI obligations to apply 
after a relationship is established. 

BDs  utilize  many  forms  of  communications  to  make  potential  new  clients  aware  of  the  BD’s 
services – whether it be television, radio, print, or social media using video or print. The purpose of these 

1 ADISA (Alternative & Direct Investment Securities Association) is the nation’s largest trade association for the 
non-traded alternative investment space (i.e., retail vs. institutional). Through its 5,000 financial industry members 
(over 1,000 firms), ADISA reaches over 220,000 finance professionals, with sponsor members raising in excess of 
$200 billion annually, serving more than 1 million investors. ADISA is a non-profit organization (501(c)(6)), 
registered to lobby, and also has a related 501(c)(3) charitable non-profit (ADISA Foundation) assisting with 
scholarships and educational efforts. 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
communications is to provide the BD the opportunity to start a conversation with a potential new client, 
providing  information  about  the  services  provided  and  not  specific  products  (a  “first  touch” 
communication).  However,  Rule  2210  and  its  associated  interpretation  and  guidance  requires  so  much 
information  be  included  in  all  types  of  communications,  making  what  is  meant  to  be  a  “first  touch” 
communication cumbersome in today’s world of limited attention span when all the BD is looking for in 
an inbound communication from a potential new client. With the implementation of the heightened best 
interest standard found in SEC’s Regulation Best Interest (“Reg BI”)2, including the associated disclosure 
and care obligations, a communication may prompt a potential new client to reach out to a BD or registered 
person,  but  that  is  only  the  beginning  of  establishing  a  relationship  between  an  investor  and  the 
BD/registered person. When these communications are designed to be the “first touch” with a potential new 
client, they become largely irrelevant once the relationship between the BD/registered person and the client 
is established. Given the obligations required to be fulfilled by a BD or registered person pursuant to Reg 
BI,  respondents  to  the  ADISA  survey  request  a  relaxed  disclosure  standard  for  such  “first  touch” 
communications to enable the communications to be more quickly digested by viewers, after which the BD 
will communicate to the client the information and considerations required by Reg BI. 

b.  Use of Investment Objectives in Communications.   

ADISA  requests  that  FINRA  permit  BDs  to  communicate  investment 
objectives of products to potential investors, ensuring full disclosure, level 
competition with issuers, and the protections of Reg BI. 

The prohibition against providing information regarding investment objectives of an investment 
product is withholding material information from investors and is counter to providing investors with full 
disclosure  regarding  an  investment.  Allowing  communications  to  include  the  disclosure  of  investment 
objectives,  together  with  underlying  assumptions,  allows  investors  to  make  a  complete  analysis  of  the 
investment,  including  potential  risks  and  rewards,  and  ultimately  make  a  more  informed  investment 
decision. 

BDs are not on a level playing field with issuers who sell directly to the public. Issuers who sell 
directly to the public are not subject to the same disclosure standards as BDs. Investors who invest directly 
with an issuer are not receiving the benefit of working with a regulated entity with the duties and obligations 
of  Reg  BI.  Allowing  the  BD  to  communicate  the  investment  objectives  of  an  offering  with  potential 
investors would place the BD on a level playing field with issuer who sells directly to investors, help drive 
additional business to the BDs and provide the investors with the protections of Reg BI. 

2.  Rule 3110.19 – Residential Supervisory Location.   

ADISA recommends that FINRA permit new principals with prior supervisory experience to 
qualify for a Residential Supervisory Location in their first year, supporting smaller BDs. 

Rule  3110.19  sets  forth  the  criteria  for  allowing  the  designation  of  a  Residential  Supervisory 
Location (“RSL”). Within this rule, subsection (c) sets forth circumstances under which a location may be 
ineligible to be designated as an RSL, including “(c)(1) is a designated supervisor who has less than one 
year of direct supervisory experience with the member, or an affiliate or subsidiary of the member that is 
registered  as  a  broker-dealer  or  investment  adviser.”  In  the  current  environment  of  continued  remote

working  post-Covid  and  the  challenge  of  finding  and  retaining  qualified  talent, specifically  supervisory 
talent,  this  restriction  creates  significant  hardship  on  BDs,  particularly  smaller  BDs,  in  attracting  and 
retaining the most talented people. It would be very helpful to allow new principals/series 24 principals to 
have an RSL within the first year of being hired for supervisory duties with a BD if they have engaged in 
similar supervisory duties in prior employment situations.   

3.  Rule 3270 - Outside Business Activities of Registered Persons.   

ADISA  recommends  that  FINRA  exempt  non-financial  or  non-securities  related 
outside business activities from Form U4 disclosure and approval requirements to 
avoid unnecessary client confusion and administrative burden. 

Rule 3270 requires a registered person to report any activities for which the registered person has 
a reasonable expectation of receiving compensation, and the approval of such activity by that person’s BD 
(Item 13 of the Form U4). With the rise of registered persons taking on additional non-investment or non-
security based “side gigs,” the registered person should not have to go through this process with activities 
which  are  clearly  non-financial  or  non-security  based  outside  business  activities  (i.e.,  a  server  at  a 
restaurant, an UBER/Lyft driver, a Walmart associate, etc.). In the event FINRA determines that the process 
of having the BD review and approve all outside business activities (regardless of type of activity) must 
stay in place, such non-financial or non-security based outside business activities should not be required to 
be disclosed on the registered person’s Form U4.  Disclosure of non-financial or non-security based outside 
business activities are irrelevant to such person’s client facing recommendations and could be interpreted 
by a client as a need for supplemental income because the person is not sufficiently successful to make a 
living as a registered person.   

4.  Form U4 Disclosures (Item 14 of the Form U4).   

ADISA  requests  that  FINRA  clarify  online  BrokerCheck  disclosures  to  avoid 
duplication and confusion for clients. 

FINRA requires disclosure of certain types of information, including certain criminal, regulatory 
actions, civil judicial, customer complaint/arbitration/civil litigation, termination, and financial disclosures, 
as well as others. Some respondents to ADISA’s survey stated that double disclosure (one by FINRA and 
one by the firm or associated person) creates confusion with clients, making it look like there are more 
disclosures than there actually are. ADISA proposes an update to the BrokerCheck information provided to 
the public in order to streamline how these disclosures appear and to make clear that if a single disclosure 
event has two entries (one by FINRA and one by the firm or associated person), it is presented in a way 
that it is clear that both entries are associated with a single disclosure event.  

5.  SEC Rule 506(b) Offerings.   

ADISA requests that FINRA update its interpretation of “substantive pre-existing 
relationship”  to  allow  BDs  to  recommend  evergreen  private  placements  to  newer 
clients, ensuring greater investor choice and compliance with Reg BI. 

ADISA received the most comments on FINRA's interpretation of the “substantive pre-existing 
relationship”  before  allowing  client  participation  in  private  placements.  A  substantive  pre-existing 
relationship  is  not  required  by  SEC  Rule  506(b)  but  instead  has  been  noted  by  the  SEC  that  if  such  a 
relationship exists, the relationship is conclusive evidence that an investor was not attracted to an offering 
through general solicitation (a Rule 506(c) offering). 

3 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
As  alternative  investments  continue  to  expand,  there  are  a  greater  number  of  issuers  who  are 
offering evergreen private offerings, sometimes providing for a continuous offering for 10 years or more. 
The  requirement  for  a  substantive  pre-existing  relationship  between  a  BD  and  a  client  prior  to  the  BD 
signing the selling agreement to sell such a continuous private offering, prevents any new client after the 
time of signing the selling agreement from making an investment in such offering, which prohibition could 
last  for  10  years  or  more.    This  requirement  serves  to  reduce  investor  choice  and  require  substantial, 
complicated  tracking  by  the  BD  and  its  associated  persons  with  respect  to  when  an  offering  was  first 
available and when the investor became a client.  

Preventing a BD from recommending an evergreen offering unnecessarily (1) limits the investment 
opportunities for newer clients and (2) constrains capital raising for the issuer. One of the benefits of being 
able  to  offer  a  continuous  offering  is  that  the  BD  and  clients  have  operating  and  financial  information 
regarding  the  investment’s  performance  and  the  associated  potential  risks  and  rewards.  Additionally, 
allowing new clients to participate in such offerings provides an opportunity for the BD to choose from a 
larger pool of investment opportunities to meet the best interest of the newer client in the same way as an 
established client. Making these investments unavailable to newer clients could conflict with Reg BI in the 
event that the 506(b) offering is in the best interest of the newer client, but unavailable to that client because 
of the restrictions of the “substantive pre-existing relationship” requirement. 

ADISA requests that FINRA update the interpretation of “substantive pre-existing relationship” to 

reduce these negative, unintended consequences to newer BD clients. 

6.  Rule 3130 Annual Certification of Compliance and Supervisory Process for Smaller Broker 

Dealers.   

ADISA urges FINRA to issue guidance clarifying that, for smaller broker-dealers, 
an in-person or formal meeting with the CCO is not required as part of the CEO 
certification process. 

Rule 3130 sets forth the requirements that the Chief Executive Officer of a BD certify annually 
“that the member has in place processes to establish, maintain, review, test and modify written compliance 
policies and written supervisory procedures reasonably designed to achieve compliance with applicable 
FINRA rules, MSRB rules and federal securities laws and regulations, and that the chief executive officer(s) 
has conducted one or more meetings with the chief compliance officer(s) in the preceding 12 months to 
discuss such processes.” 

Often within smaller BDs (by headcount), the CEO and the CCO are the same individual. Requiring 
the CEO and CCO to meet within the preceding 12 months of the CEO certification simply does not make 
sense in these situations. ADISA asks for guidance for smaller BDs that an in-person or formal meeting 
does not need to occur in connection with the CEO certification process. 

ADISA appreciates the opportunity to provide input. We would be happy to discuss our concerns 

further and to continue to assist FINRA further in modernizing its rules, interpretations and guidance. 

Sincerely,

Re: 

FINRA Regulatory Notice 25-04 

Dear Ms. Mitchell: 

The Investment Company Institute1 appreciates the opportunity to comment on FINRA’s review of its 
rules and guidance.2 We commend FINRA for undertaking this broad and timely review in pursuit of 
“vibrant capital markets where everyone can invest with confidence.”  

As part of this project, we recommend that FINRA modernize Rule 2210 (Communications with the 
Public), related rules and guidance, and their administration by:  

•  Aligning its requirements with those of the SEC’s 2020 marketing rule for investment advisers,3 

including with respect to the use of performance information; 

•  Modernizing social media guidance; 
•  Engaging with members to understand how firms are using artificial intelligence before 

determining whether additional guidance would be beneficial; 

•  Permitting members to present data regarding a fund’s average credit quality in certain 

communications with the public;  
Improving the review process to enhance timeliness and consistency; and 

• 
•  Revisiting the requirement to include a member’s full name in communications. 

1 The Investment Company Institute (ICI) is the leading association representing the asset management industry in 
service of individual investors. ICI’s members include mutual funds, exchange-traded funds (ETFs), closed-end 
funds, and unit investment trusts (UITs) in the United States, and UCITS and similar funds offered to investors in 
other jurisdictions. Its members manage $37.7 trillion invested in funds registered under the US Investment 
Company Act of 1940, serving more than 120 million investors. Members manage an additional $9.6 trillion in 
regulated fund assets managed outside the United States. ICI also represents its members in their capacity as 
investment advisers to collective investment trusts (CITs) and retail separately managed accounts (SMAs). ICI has 
offices in Washington DC, Brussels, and London.

Section 1: FINRA Should Modernize Rules and Guidance Governing Communications with the 
Public 

The Regulatory Notice identifies as benefits of engagement between FINRA and its member firms “better 
understand[ing] and address[ing] risks to investors and markets; better adapt[ing] its oversight to 
changing business practices and markets; [and] better support[ing] innovation and the deployment of new 
technologies and services that benefit markets and investors…” We believe FINRA’s communications 
with the public rules are especially ripe for this kind of engagement and review. FINRA last reviewed that 
ruleset beginning in 2014, and that process yielded sensible rule amendments and guidance. Since then, 
however, the SEC comprehensively overhauled its Marketing Rule for investment advisers, and FINRA’s 
parallel ruleset has not kept pace. ICI members’ communications with the public—e.g., registered 
investment company (“fund”) marketing materials—are frequently subject to the content standards and 
filing requirements of FINRA Rule 2210, and we offer several recommendations to improve the rule and 
its administration below. 

1.1  FINRA Should Align Rule 2210 with the SEC Marketing Rule 

ICI has long supported harmonization of the FINRA and SEC marketing standards (the former apply to 
broker-dealers, and by extension funds, while the latter apply to registered investment advisers). Having 
differing regulatory frameworks applicable to funds and advisers creates a compliance challenge for our 
members. Even slight differences in applicable standards are difficult to operationalize and potentially 
confusing to investors. We believe that FINRA should follow the SEC’s lead here.  

Specifically, FINRA should align its performance reporting standards with those of the Marketing Rule. 
Subject to appropriate investor protections, the SEC permits investment advisers to show related 
performance, extracted performance, hypothetical performance, and predecessor performance, including 
to certain retail customers.4 In permitting these types of performance information, the SEC explained that 
“related performance can be a valuable tool to assist an investor in evaluating a particular investment 
adviser or investment strategy, and that its use is consistent with industry practice.”5 With respect to 
hypothetical performance, the SEC acknowledged certain risks but ultimately stated that it “understand[s] 
that . . . hypothetical performance may be useful to prospective investors who have the resources and 
financial expertise” and that “the information may allow an investor to evaluate an adviser’s investment 

4 The Marketing Rule includes the following definitions of these terms: 

• 

• 

• 

• 

“Extracted Performance means the performance results of a subset of investments extracted from a 
portfolio.” Rule 206(4)-1(e)(6); 

“Hypothetical Performance means performance results that were not actually achieved by any portfolio of 
the investment adviser,” which includes performance derived from model portfolios, performance that is 
back tested by the application of a strategy to data from prior time periods when the strategy was not 
actually used during those time periods, and targeted or projected performance returns. Rule 206(4)-1(e)(8); 

“Predecessor Performance means investment performance achieved by a group of investments consisting 
of an account or a private fund that was not advised at all times during the period shown by the investment 
adviser advertising the performance.” Rule 206(4)-1(e)(12); and 

“Related Performance means the performance results of one or more related portfolios,” which in turn is 
defined to mean “a portfolio with substantially similar investment policies, objectives, and strategies as 
those of the services being offered in the advertisement.” Rule 206(4)-1(e)(14)-(15).

process over a wide range of periods and market environments or form reasonable expectations about 
how the investment process might perform under different conditions.”6  

Harmonization is easiest in those areas where FINRA already has taken steps toward a more permissive 
approach. For instance, in 2023, FINRA proposed rule amendments related to performance projections 
and targeted returns,7 which ICI supported but found unduly modest.8 We viewed this proposal as a step 
in the right direction toward harmonization, and it was never clear to us why such a modest and broadly 
supported proposal was not adopted by the SEC.9  

FINRA has also laid groundwork for further harmonization through various letters, which permit the 
inclusion of related performance and hypothetical back-tested performance in certain institutional 
communications, but not retail communications, subject to certain conditions.10 Indeed, the case for 
broader permitted use of related performance information (including for retail investors) is especially 
strong, given that the adviser has achieved the stated performance for other similar accounts and funds 
that it manages. These forms of performance information, when presented with appropriate disclosures 
and subject to safeguards, are potentially informative and helpful to retail investors making investment 
decisions.11  

6 Id. at 13078. The SEC also specifically declined to impose separate requirements for performance advertising in 
retail and non-retail advertisements. 

7 Self-Regulatory Organizations; Financial Industry Regulatory Authority, Inc.; Notice of Filing of a Proposed Rule 
Change To Amend FINRA Rule 2210 (Communications With the Public) To Permit Projections of Performance of 
Investment Strategies or Single Securities in Institutional Communications, SEC Release No. 34–98977, 88 Fed. 
Reg. 82482 (Nov. 24, 2023), available at https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/FR-2023-11-24/pdf/2023-25881.pdf. 
This proposal would have permitted the use of targets or projections in communications subject to certain 
conditions, including that the use of targets or projections would have been limited to (i) institutional 
communications or (ii) communications that are distributed or made available only to qualified purchasers (“QPs”) 
and that promote or recommend specified non-public offerings. 

8 Letter from ICI to the SEC, ICI (Dec. 15, 2023), available at https://www.sec.gov/comments/sr-finra-2023-
016/srfinra2023016-314280-819322.pdf. We continue to believe that the current rule’s near-prohibition on projected 
performance is unduly restrictive and prevents FINRA members from communicating in ways that help investors 
better understand the risk and return characteristics of investment portfolios. Unlike the Marketing Rule, the 
proposal would have limited the use of projections and targets to institutional and certain QP communications, and 
we recommended that FINRA broaden the reach of any final rule amendments to include retail investors, consistent 
with the Marketing Rule. 

9 In July 2024, the SEC stayed an order that had been issued by its Division of Trading and Markets just one week 
earlier approving the proposal. To our knowledge, there have been no further developments. 

10 See, e.g., Interpretive Letter to Edward P. Macdonald, Hartford Funds Distributors, LLC, FINRA (May 12, 
2015), available at https://www.finra.org/rules-guidance/guidance/interpretive-letters/interpretive-letter-edward-p-
macdonald-hartford-funds-distributors-llc; and Interpretive Letter to Bradley J. Swenson, ALPS Distributors, Inc., 
FINRA (Apr. 22, 2013), available at https://www.finra.org/rules-guidance/guidance/interpretive-letters/bradley-j-
swenson-alps-distributors-inc. As discussed below, FINRA’s reliance on various informal notices and no-action 
letters to communicate FINRA’s position on these topics may lead to confusion and inconsistent practices in the 
industry, and we encourage FINRA to clearly address them in Rule 2210 itself. 

11 For example, we understand that certain retirement plan fiduciaries have requested related performance and, in 
some cases, have requested to share it with plan participants. This is an example where the current FINRA rule may 
restrict the provision of potentially helpful information to investors.  

 
 
Jennifer Piorko Mitchell 
June 10, 2025 
Page 4 of 7  

We also urge FINRA to incorporate long-standing FINRA guidance and positions into the text of Rule 
2210 itself, much as the SEC did when it amended its Marketing Rule. FINRA has historically issued 
guidance through regulatory notices and letters, many of which substantively alter obligations and/or 
permitted activities under the rule, and this retrospective review provides an opportunity for FINRA to 
codify certain guidance in the rule itself. We believe this would increase transparency, aid interpretation 
and compliance, and decrease uncertainty regarding members’ obligations.  

1.2  FINRA Should Clarify and Provide Additional Guidance Relating to the Use of Social Media 

ICI members’ use of social media to advertise their services and provide educational and other investor 
materials continues to grow and evolve with respect to both content (e.g., use of “finfluencers”) and 
medium, and we encourage FINRA to review and clarify its existing guidance on this topic. In addition to 
written social media posts, member firms now frequently use audio and/or video social media. We 
encourage FINRA to engage with industry participants regarding their use of social media and what 
additional guidance may be helpful. We also encourage FINRA to consider consolidating and codifying 
its approach to the use of social media within Rule 2210 itself (or other appropriate rules). 

For instance, Question 2 and its answer in FINRA Regulatory Notice 17-18 provide examples of social 
media posts that are not subject to Rule 2210.12 We request that FINRA provide additional examples of 
content that similarly would not be subject to Rule 2210, including general educational content promoting 
account types (e.g., IRAs or 401(k) plans), general approaches to investing, and/or financial literacy.13 
Member firms frequently prepare educational materials that do not pertain to a firm’s specific products or 
services, but the current guidance’s failure to specifically address these materials has created uncertainty 
and impeded creation and dissemination of these investor-friendly materials. These types of materials, 

Another difference between the FINRA and SEC performance-related requirements is that FINRA Rule 2210 (by 
reference to SEC Rule 482) requires that performance be shown as of the most recent 1, 5, and 10 years and the 
most recent quarter end, while the Marketing Rule requires that performance be shown as of the most recent 1, 5, 
and 10 year periods and permits the inclusion of more recent performance. Members have expressed frustration that, 
even if they have more recent performance information available, under the FINRA rule, they must show 
performance as of the most recent quarter-end. We encourage FINRA to consider coordinating with the SEC to align 
the Rule 2210/Rule 482 approach with the Marketing Rule approach.  

There are also non-performance-related differences between Rule 2210 and the Marketing Rule that FINRA should 
address. For example, members report challenges regarding the different definitions and requirements with respect 
to testimonials under the separate regulatory frameworks. 

12 FINRA Regulatory Notice 17-18, Guidance on Social Networking Websites and Business Communications, 
FINRA (Apr. 25, 2017), available at https://www.finra.org/rules-guidance/notices/17-18. The guidance states that, if 
an associated person of a firm in a personal communication shares or links to content that the firm makes available 
in its communications that does not concern the firm’s products or services, the associated person’s communication 
would not be subject to Rule 2210. The guidance provides examples of such content, including information about 
the firm’s sponsorship of a charitable event, a human-interest article, an employment opportunity, or employer 
information covered by state and federal fair employment laws. 

13 Additional clarity regarding certain communications by dually registered firms may also be helpful. For example, 
such a firm may issue communications on behalf of the investment advisory business, which may include references 
to underlying holdings (e.g., mutual funds, ETFs, or individual stocks or bonds). FINRA should clarify that, despite 
these references, these materials are not subject to Rule 2210 content or filing requirements for retail 
communications, because they do not make any financial or investment recommendation or otherwise promote a 
product or service of the member.

like the other examples already included in the FINRA guidance, do not raise investor protection concerns 
and should be considered outside the scope of Rule 2210.  

1.3  FINRA Should Engage with Industry Participants on the Use of Artificial Intelligence Before 

Considering Additional Guidance on This Topic 

ICI members use technology to identify and engage with investors in a variety of ways, including: 
disseminating educational information about products and services; providing analytical tools and 
research (including tools that facilitate planning and saving for retirement, buying a home, education, and 
other important financial goals); and offering advisory services, including both full-service advice with a 
dedicated financial adviser and online robo-advisory platforms. To date, ICI member firms have not 
indicated that AI technology is used on a standalone basis and have stressed that AI should be viewed as 
an augmentative technology that can enhance human decision-making processes without replacing human 
expertise and oversight. Further, member firms have strong compliance and governance structures around 
the use (or potential use) of AI and, at this time, do not use AI technology without human oversight and 
responsibility over the final output.  

However, technology continues to develop rapidly, and members continue to explore ways to enhance 
their AI processes. FINRA has issued two FAQs on the use of AI-generated communications,14 and we 
appreciate that FINRA has applied the existing regulatory framework to the use of AI. Those FAQs 
provide high-level confirmation that the content standards of Rule 2210 apply whether member firms’ 
communications are generated by a human or technology tool and that firms are responsible for 
supervising chatbot communications in accordance with applicable FINRA rules. We encourage FINRA 
to engage with members to understand how firms are using AI before determining whether additional 
guidance would be beneficial.  

1.4  FINRA Should Permit Members to Present a Fund’s Average Credit Quality in 

Communications with the Public 

FINRA has taken the position that fund advertising materials may not present the fund’s average credit 
quality (i.e., a single average or composite of the credit quality ratings of the fund’s portfolio holdings, 
which may take into account ratings by multiple rating agencies) as calculated by the fund, rather than by 
a nationally recognized statistical ratings organization (“NRSRO”). We understand that FINRA is 
concerned about the utility or effectiveness of this information as a risk metric, non-standardization in 
calculation methodologies, and the treatment of unrated securities, as well as firms potentially presenting 
the data in misleading ways. 

We understand FINRA’s concerns and acknowledge that there are other valid and more comprehensive 
ways to present information about a fund’s credit quality. Still, we believe that permitting firms to include 
fund-calculated average credit quality ratings in their communications, when accompanied by appropriate 
disclosure, could provide investors with a helpful summary metric. Such an average credit quality rating 
may be easier for investors to understand and would provide funds with greater latitude to showcase their 
managers’ credit quality assessments. Accordingly, we request that FINRA permit the inclusion of this 
information, subject to appropriate disclosures (e.g., highlighting key methodological choices and the 

14 Frequently Asked Questions About Advertising Regulation, Questions B.4 and D.8, FINRA (May 10, 2024), 
available at https://www.finra.org/rules-guidance/guidance/faqs/advertising-regulation#b4.  

 
 
 
Jennifer Piorko Mitchell 
June 10, 2025 
Page 6 of 7  

limits of this metric) and other conditions (e.g., allowing inclusion only in institutional communications, 
or imposing certain methodological requirements).  

1.5  FINRA Should Consider Ways to Improve the Rule 2210 Review Process  

We greatly appreciate that FINRA has taken steps to promote consistency and timeliness of its reviews of, 
and comments on, member communications, and many ICI members report improved turnaround times. 
Nevertheless, this experience is not universal, and we encourage FINRA to continue to improve its review 
process to ensure that comments are both consistent across firms and timely. Some members report that 
they have received comments raising issues with certain practices or approaches that other FINRA 
members utilize. Members have also raised concerns that the comment process itself occasionally creates 
new substantive requirements outside existing rules or guidance. Many members have also continued to 
express frustration with the timeliness of FINRA reviews, including the inconsistency and 
unpredictability of the review timelines. We recognize the challenges of this work and encourage FINRA 
to explore ways to streamline or modernize the filing review process.  

Additionally, ICI understands that in cases where a firm receives comments on advertising materials, it 
has become common industry practice for that firm to refile those materials after addressing FINRA’s 
comments in order to obtain a so-called “clean” letter from FINRA. We understand that this is not due to 
any FINRA requirement, but is done in response to third-party broker-dealer requirements. This practice 
not only increases the burdens on FINRA staff and resources but also delays members’ use of materials 
and increases costs. FINRA has previously acknowledged this practice and its contribution to the number 
of “voluntary” filings that FINRA staff reviews each year.15  

We believe that this practice has grown, at least in part, as a result of Rule 2210(b)(1)(C), which exempts 
retail communications from the registered principal review and approval requirement of Rule 
2210(b)(1)(A) if another member has previously filed the communication with FINRA and “has received 
a letter from [FINRA] stating that [the communication] appears to be consistent with applicable 
standards.” Accordingly, we encourage FINRA to amend this portion of the rule, or provide applicable 
guidance, to clarify that it is unnecessary to refile materials and obtain a “clean” letter before using such 
materials without registered principal review and approval. For example, FINRA could consider 
broadening the provision to exempt retail communications if another member has received a clean letter 
or has attested to having appropriately addressed and resolved any FINRA comments received on the 
communication. Clear guidance that advertising materials may be used even without a clean letter may 
provide comfort to third parties and decrease voluntary filings.  

1.6  FINRA Should Modernize the Requirement to Include a Member’s Full Name in 

Communications with the Public 

Rule 2210(d)(3) requires retail communications to prominently disclose the FINRA member’s name. 
Despite significant changes in technology and how investors consume information, this requirement has 
not been changed since it was adopted in 2014. Today, many electronic advertisements must fit into small 
spaces (e.g., on mobile or wearable devices) and use few characters (e.g., social media posts on X 

15 Retrospective Rule Review Report, Communications with the Public, FINRA (Dec. 2014), available at 
https://www.finra.org/sites/default/files/p602011.pdf (“Approximately 21 percent of the responding member firms 
filed communications on a voluntary basis last year. Voluntary filings were more prevalent among larger firms. For 
example, 70 percent of the large responding firms filed on a voluntary basis. The most common reason reported for 
voluntary filings was to obtain FINRA review prior to launching a marketing campaign (60 percent of the voluntary 
filers), followed by filing to obtain “clean” letters for downstream broker-dealers (50 percent)”) (emphasis added).

(formerly Twitter)). In these and similar circumstances, it may not be possible or practicable to include a 
member’s full name. Hyperlinks may allow a firm to include an abbreviated (but still generally 
recognizable) name and provide investors with ready access to more information about the FINRA 
member. Accordingly, we encourage FINRA to make this provision more flexible, allowing firms to 
develop a reasonable approach to providing their names in communications more efficiently without 
compromising investor protections.

RE: Comment Letter Regarding FINRA Regulatory Notice 25-04 / FINRA Launches 
Broad Review to Modernize Rules Regarding Member Firms and Associated Persons 

Dear Ms. Mitchell: 

I  write  on  behalf  of  the  Public  Investors  Advocate  Bar  Association  (""PIABA”),  an 
international  bar  association  comprised  of  attorneys  who  represent  investors  in  in  securities 
arbitration and litigation. Since its formation in 1990, PIABA has promoted the interests of public 
investors in all securities and commodities arbitration forums, while also advocating for public 
education  regarding  investment  fraud  and  industry  misconduct.  Our  members  represent  and 
advocate for investors harmed by fraud, misconduct, and the damage caused by members of the 
securities industry who put their interests ahead of their clients. As a result of representing the 
public investors, PIABA is in the unique position to uncover patterns of conduct and regulatory 
inefficiencies that lead to customers being misled, misinformed, or mistreated. 

Our members and their clients have a strong interest in rules promulgated by the Financial 
Industry Regulatory Authority (“FINRA”) particularly relating to investor protection issues. As 
such, PIABA frequently comments upon proposed rule changes and retrospective rule reviews to 
protect the rights and fair treatment of the investing public. 

Background 

PIABA agrees substantial improvements can be made to modernize the FINRA Rules and 
regulatory landscape to better address the risks to investors and the markets. However, PIABA 
believes that any efforts to modernize FINRA Rules and standards must prioritize and strengthen 
investor protection. FINRA’s notice is admittedly rather broad, but PIABA suggests several areas 
that  FINRA  should  focus  on  in  modernization  efforts  to  balance  the  interests  of  protecting  the 
investing public and integrity of the capital markets.  

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
In short, PIABA supports a variety of common-sense amendments and improvements that 
will  enhance  investor  protection,  but  PIABA  encourages  FINRA  to  ensure  that  any  considered 
changes  would  prioritize  the  strengthening  of  investor  protection  and  integrity  of  the  markets. 
PIABA looks forward to the opportunity to comment on any future proposals. 

I. 

Remote Inspections 

In 2024, FINRA launched its voluntary, three-year Remote Inspections Pilot Program (the 
“Pilot  Program”),  allowing  eligible  member  firms  to  meet  their  inspection  obligations  under 
FINRA Rule 3110 without conducting on-site visits. While we understand the intent to modernize 
regulatory  oversight  in  a  remote  work  environment,  PIABA  submits  this  comment  to  express 
strong  concerns  that  movements  towards  entirely  remote  and  disconnected  supervision  and 
inspections undermine FINRA’s foundational mission of investor protection. 

The  flexibility  granted  by  the  Pilot  Program  creates  a  significant  gap  in  supervision, 
particularly  for  representatives  operating  out  of  residential  or  remote  offices.  This  structure 
increases the risk of misconduct, including sales abuses and regulatory evasion, especially in cases 
where representatives work in isolation without direct, in-person oversight. 

In prior comments, PIABA highlighted numerous regulatory actions involving brokers who 
engaged in misconduct—such as ""selling away"" or orchestrating Ponzi schemes—from remote, 
often  one-person  offices.  These  cases,  cited  by  both  FINRA  and  the  SEC,  underscore  the 
heightened  supervisory  challenges  such  environments  pose.  See  PIABA  Comment  Letter  to 
Vanessa Countryman, File No. SR-FINRA-2022-019 (November 22, 2022), pp. 3-4. Given this 
reality, reducing or eliminating on-site inspections for such locations amplifies fraud probabilities 
and weakens investor safeguards. 

FINRA’s  position,  that  firms  can  rely  on  remote  surveillance  and  technological  tools  to 
supervise representatives, fails to fully address the limitations of such methods. As PIABA has 
previously noted, observing certain red flags requires physical presence. For example, in-person 
audits allow compliance personnel to observe indicators of potential misconduct—such as signs 
of financial excess, physical marketing materials for unauthorized investments, or other evidence 
of off-the-books activity. These types of risks are difficult, if not impossible, to detect remotely. 

We acknowledge that remote supervision tools can complement a firm’s oversight framework. 
However, they should not replace in-person inspections—particularly for residential supervisory 
locations.  At  a  minimum,  these  locations  should  be  subject  to  annual,  unannounced,  in-person 
audits. Even inspections every three years would be preferable to eliminating them entirely. To 
suggest otherwise is to accept a diminished standard of oversight and, by extension, diminished 
investor protection. 

We urge FINRA to reconsider the Pilot Program’s structure and adopt more robust safeguards 
to ensure that all investor-facing offices, regardless of location, remain subject to effective and 
meaningful supervision.

II. 

Account Statement Modernization  

PIABA  has  noticed  concerning  trends  of  investors  being  unable  to  track  their  investments 
recommended to them by members and their associated persons. PIABA believes member firms 
ought to be required to modernize the brokerage account statements they provide their customers 
to include insurance products and non-conventional investments (“NCIs”), among other things, 
that their registered representatives sell to their brokerage customers, especially when the member 
or associated person receive compensation for the sale of those investments or they are sold or 
held through the same brokerage or affiliated entities.  

As  the  financial  services  landscape  continues  to  evolve,  so  too  must  the  tools  and 
disclosures investors rely upon to make informed decisions. Today’s investors are often sold a 
variety of products ranging from diverse portfolios that span traditional securities such as stocks, 
bonds, ETFs, and mutual funds, as well as complex investment products. These more complex 
investments  include  products  such  as  insurance-based  products  (e.g.,  variable  annuities  and 
indexed universal life policies), and NCIs such as private placements, real estate investment trusts 
(REITs),  or  alternative  funds.  These  products  are  frequently  sold  by  the  same  registered 
representatives  under  the  umbrella  of  a  single  broker-dealer  or  affiliated  entities.  Yet,  these 
products are often excluded from the investor’s regular brokerage statements, creating fragmented 
and potentially misleading representations of their financial position.  

From  a  compliance  and  supervisory  perspective,  integrated  reporting  allows  firms  and 
regulators to better monitor for sales practice abuses, overconcentration, best-interest or suitability 
type concerns, and improper switching between product types. When products are omitted from 
account  statements,  it  becomes  more  difficult  to  identify  red  flags  or  patterns  of  misconduct. 
Likewise,  from  an  investor  perspective,  it  creates  a  confusing,  fragmented  view  of  their 
investments,  especially  seniors  and  other  vulnerable  investors.  In  PIABA’s  experience,  retail 
investors  face  confusion  and  harm  due  to  their  inability  to  follow  their  investments  status, 
performance, and a variety of complex name changes and corporate actions. 

The  financial  industry  today  possesses  the  technological  capabilities  to  incorporate  these 
products into comprehensive, unified statements. Many broker-dealers already maintain back-end 
data systems that track these holdings for internal use or compensation purposes. Extending this 
data to investor-facing statements is a logical and achievable next step. Moreover, doing so would 
promote  consistency  across  firms  and  reduce  investor  confusion  when  comparing  offerings.  In 
addition,  investors  should  be  provided  an  opportunity  for  efficient  electronic  access  to  account 
statements and tools to fully track their investments.  

Should FINRA consider enhancements to Rule 2231 and related guidance, I respectfully 
recommend  that  it  explicitly  require  the  inclusion  of  insurance  products,  non-conventional 
investments,  and  other  products  sold  or  held  through  affiliated  entities  in  customer  account 
statements. Doing so would modernize account disclosures, strengthen investor protection, and 
align reporting practices with the realities of today’s financial markets.

III. 

Issues Regarding Collection and Storage of Electronic Communications 

Associated persons of member firms now have access to a nearly endless number of options 
to communicate with customers—including text messaging, WhatsApp, and other internet-based 
services.  These  “alternative”  and  often  unapproved  and  unsupervised  messaging  platforms  are 
increasingly being used to engage with customers. PIABA members have observed a troubling 
rise in misconduct, including “selling away” and material misrepresentations, that occur via these 
unofficial and unmonitored communication platforms. These methods enable associated persons 
to communicate with customers in ways that circumvent regulatory oversight and firm compliance 
functions. 

A.  Communication Platform Disclosure 

To address this risk, associated persons should be required to disclose all communication 
platforms  they  use  to  engage  with  clients,  in  the  same  manner  they  are  currently  obligated  to 
disclose outside business activities. Member firms and regulators must strictly prohibit the use of 
any  non-disclosed  or  unmonitored  communication  methods.  Moreover,  there  should  be  a 
presumption of impropriety associated with the use of any undisclosed communication platform—
creating  a  liability  framework  that  shifts  the  burden  to  the  associated  person  and  firm.  This 
deterrent  would  reduce  misconduct  and  protect  investors  from  individuals  attempting  to  evade 
supervision. 

B.  Record Retention on Separation 

In addition to proactive monitoring, member firms should be required to obtain a forensic 
copy of all electronic communications between associated persons and customers on an annual 
basis, or at a minimum upon the termination of an associated person’s employment. These records 
often play a critical role in FINRA arbitration proceedings. Unfortunately, firms frequently claim 
that relevant communications are unavailable because they are stored on an associated person’s 
personal device, allegedly beyond the firm’s control. Courts, however, have repeatedly held that 
employers can and must produce such records where relevant. See, e.g., In re Gonzalez, 2022 WL 
17583628, at *8 (S.D. Fla. Aug. 8, 2022) (citing Matter of Skanska USA Civ. SE Inc., 2021 WL 
4953239  (N.D.  Fla.  Aug.  5,  2021)  and  State  Farm  Mut.  Auto.  Ins.  Co.  v.  Precious  Physical 
Therapy, 2020 WL 7056039 (E.D. Mich. Dec. 2, 2020)). 

C.  Reasonably Accessible Record Storage Standards 

Member  firms  should  not  be  permitted  to  ignore  their  supervisory  obligations  while 
benefiting  from  the  very  misconduct  they  fail  to  prevent.  Member  firms  often  resist  producing 
documents that are presumptively discoverable under the FINRA Discovery Guide, citing undue 
burden based on their own poor recordkeeping practices. Specifically, firms claim that searching 
for  responsive  documents  is  difficult  because  records  are  not  stored  in  a  searchable  electronic 
format. This problem is entirely self-created. In the modern era, virtually all documents originate 
in digital form and can easily be made searchable. Firms that convert documents to paper and then 
re-scan  them  without  using  OCR  software  embrace  inefficiency  to  deliberately  obstruct  the 
discoverability and usability of their records. This conduct frustrates both regulatory oversight and 
the fair administration of arbitration.  It is inconsistent with the “high standards of commercial 

4 

 
 
 
 
honor and just and equitable principles of trade” that FINRA demands from its Members.  FINRA 
Rule 2010. 

FINRA should modernize its expectations and require member firms to store all documents in 
standardized, searchable formats—such as PDF/A—which many courts now require. Doing so 
would reduce regulatory burden, enhance document accessibility for customers and regulators, 
and ensure that firms cannot manipulate record formats to avoid producing usable documents. 

IV. 

Issues Regarding Commissions/Fees and Trade Cost Disclosures 

FINRA  Members  now  fail  to  provide  transparency  surrounding  the  costs  associated  with 
individual  transactions.  These  costs  include  commissions,  mark-ups  and  mark-downs,  and 
execution  prices  assigned  to  trades  as  compared  to  the  open  market  bid  and  ask  values.  While 
public investors often understand that commissions may be incurred on a specific trade, they often 
lack a clear understanding of the form of commission, or how it affects the profitability of a trade. 
In the case of mark-ups and mark-downs, public investors are often unaware that their firm might 
be charging them more, or providing less, than the firm received in a corresponding and underlying 
transaction. The aggregate costs of any commission or fees are often difficult for investors to track 
and understand, and Members should provide investors with information and data regarding the 
aggregate trading costs on a periodic basis through account statements or confirmations. Members 
already  maintain  this  type  of  data  and  information  electronically,  and  there  would  be  minimal 
burden in providing such important data to customers.   

As with many aspects of the relationship between customer and member firm, full and fair 
disclosure should be the guiding principle. Member firms should be required to disclose, in a clear 
and conspicuous manner, the precise commission paid on all trade confirmation slips. Member 
firms are already required to maintain this information, so including the data on a confirmation 
slip would not present any additional burden on firms or regulators. By contrast, providing this 
disclosure would enhance customers’ understanding of the true costs of trading and would enable 
them to make more informed decisions. Moreover, firms could offer lower transaction costs as a 
competitive advantage to benefit themselves in the marketplace. Increased competition, and lower 
consumer costs, are both benefits that support requiring disclosure. 

The same information should be included for any mark-ups or mark-downs applied to any 
trade.  Investors  deserve  to  know  how  a  firm’s  internal  trading  processes  affect  their  personal 
trading  costs,  and  when  and  how  a  firm  is  charging  them  an  amount  different  than  what  was 
available on the open market, and the percentage the customer is being charged.  

Finally,  member  firms  should  be  required  to  provide  the  intraday  high  and  low  trading 
prices for any relevant security on a confirmation slips. While firms are not currently obligated to 
provide  “best  execution,”  many  trades  for  retail  investors  are  executed  at  prices  that  fall  at  or 
beyond  the  high  or  low  of  the  trading  day.  This  practice  significantly  benefits  the  firm  while 
disadvantaging  the  customer.  Requiring  firms  to  disclose  the  day’s  trading  range  would  give 
investors valuable insight into the quality of the execution received. While such data is readily 
available from public electronic sources, firms will not voluntarily provide it, as doing so would 
underscore the profitability of their trade execution practices. However, if such disclosure were 
required industry-wide, firms could virtuously compete by delivering superior execution quality. 

5 

 
 
 
 
 
In  summary,  FINRA  member  firms  should  be  required  to  provide  the  highest  level  of 
transparency in their dealings with retail customers. Transparency promotes investor protection 
and  fosters  informed  decision-making.  Given  the  minimal  burden  on  firms  and  the  substantial 
benefit to the investing public, these suggestions deserve urgent and favorable consideration. 

V.  Modernizing “Recommendations” Across  

Various Communication and Social Media Platforms. 

As  registered  representatives  increasingly  rely  on  digital  communication  platforms, 
including social media and messaging apps, to engage with customers, it is critical that FINRA’s 
Rules and regulatory guidance reflect the realities of today’s communication landscape. Advisors 
may use tools like LinkedIn, WhatsApp, iMessage, and Instagram not only for general branding 
but also for sharing market updates and personalized commentary or recommendations. FINRA’s 
current  regulatory  framework,  which  largely  centers  on  traditional  and  firm-controlled 
communications, presents challenges in monitoring, supervision, and compliant recordkeeping in 
this evolving environment. 

FINRA’s regulatory guidance as to what constitutes a “recommendation” under Rule 2111 
or Regulation Best Interest is necessarily broad to encompass the many ways that firms and their 
representatives  can  solicit  transactions  and  investment  strategies  with  their  customers.    While 
PIABA agrees with this broad-based approach, FINRA’s Rules and guidance should continue to 
clarify that recommendations do not only occur through traditional communication channels.   

NASD  Notice  to  Members  01-23  (released  24  years  ago)  discussed  and  confirmed  that 
recommendations made through electronic communications constituted recommendations under 
NASD (now FINRA) Rules, and it gave examples of types of electronic conduct that would be 
considered  a  recommendation.    FINRA  then  issued  Regulatory  Notice  17-18  which  discussed 
social media in a compliance and regulatory context.  These types of clarifications should continue 
and should be updated to encompass current communication activities. 

To effectively modernize its rules, FINRA should consider continuing to establish clear, 
platform-agnostic guidance that confirms that ""recommendations"" can occur across various digital 
formats and communication methods. Additionally, FINRA could encourage or endorse the use of 
third-party compliance technology solutions that enable real-time monitoring and archiving of all 
digital  communications  with  customers  or  potential  customers.    By  doing  so,  FINRA  can  help 
ensure that investor protections remain intact in this age of modern communication.   

VI. 

Electronic Delivery of Offering Materials and Disclosures 

As brokerage firms become more reliant on digital tools in client interactions it is essential 
that FINRA remind its member firms that the use of these technologies does not relieve them of 
their core regulatory obligations. Specifically, we urge FINRA to issue clear and updated guidance 
emphasizing that electronic delivery of a prospectus or disclosures does not replace full fair and 
balanced disclosure obligations, and electronic signatures or “clickwrap” acknowledgements do 
not  substitute  informed  consent  or  understanding.  These  digital  processes  and  their  myriad 

6 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
disclosures  and  disclaimers  cannot  immunize  firms  against  verbal  misrepresentations  or 
misconduct,  and  firms  still  have  supervisory  responsibilities  to  ensure  their  employees  are 
complying with FINRA rules. 

The convenience of delivering disclosure documents electronically does not in any way 
diminish the obligation of brokers and brokerage firms to provide full and fair disclosure, including 
meaningful explanations of product features, costs, risks, and conflicts of interest. Simply sending 
a  prospectus  via  email  or  secure  link  does  not  fulfill  the  requirement  to  ensure  that  customers 
understand the nature and implications of the products being offered. Electronic signatures are a 
functional  equivalent  of  handwritten  signatures,  but  they  do  not  establish  that  a  customer  fully 
understood the investment or transaction. 

Member firms must continue to take steps to ensure that customers are truly informed, and 
that  consent  is  meaningful,  regardless  of  whether  the  process  is  conducted  electronically  or  in 
person. The delivery of these electronic prospectuses creates new challenges and hurdles for firms 
that were not present in an in-person meeting. The electronic process does not allow the same type 
of opportunity for customers to ask questions or about the investment itself or anything they may 
read on the prospectus. This hands-off process will require broker-dealer firms to take extra steps 
to  ensure  the  firm  has  made  full  and  fair  disclosures,  and  also  to  ensure  that  there  is  informed 
consent on the part of the customer. We urge FINRA to remind broker-dealer firms that this more 
convenient electronic delivery method brings with it more challenges and the need to update their 
procedures to ensure full and fair disclosure.  

Simply sending clients a prospectus with risk disclosures and disclaimers that contradict 
oral representations made by a registered representative of the firm cannot insulate the firm from 
liability  for  those  oral  representations.  The  integrity  of  verbal  representations  must  match  the 
content of written materials, whether delivered electronically or otherwise. Investors should not 
be left with no recourse simply because a misleading investment pitch was followed by a stack of 
fine print delivered via email. Supervisory systems must be adapted to address risks inherent in 
electronic interactions, including the need to monitor and document oral communications, track 
electronic disclosures, and ensure consistency across verbal and written representations. FINRA 
should make clear that firms are expected to supervise digital engagement with the same rigor as 
traditional channels. 

VII.  Common Sense Insurance 

PIABA strongly urges FINRA to require all member firms to maintain appropriate liability 
insurance. Our proposal addresses a long-standing and well-documented source of investor harm: 
the epidemic of unpaid FINRA arbitration awards. We also recommend that respondents in customer 
arbitration matters be required to disclose, in confidence during discovery, the existence and extent 
of any insurance coverage. Such information should remain inadmissible at the hearing. 

The rationale for insurance is simple: financial professionals and firms that harm investors 
should not be able to walk away from responsibility simply because they lack the means to pay an 
award. The current system permits firms and FINRA members to skirt responsibility. Many firms 
operate without any liability insurance, and some even structure themselves with no intention of 

7 

 
 
 
 
 
 
satisfying adverse arbitration awards. In these cases, aggrieved investors—often retirees with little 
recourse—are left empty-handed. 

This  is  not  a  new  problem.  The  Government  Accountability  Office  has  reported  that  a 
significant number of arbitration awards go unpaid. FINRA has the authority to suspend brokers and 
firms for non-payment, but that sanction provides little help to investors once their money is gone. 
Enforcement remedies only go so far if there are no assets or insurance proceeds to satisfy awards. 

PIABA has written extensively on this issue. Attached please find our recent discussion on 

insurance. 

Requiring insurance solves several problems simultaneously: 

1.  Insurance ensures recoverability. It dramatically reduces the number of unpaid awards by 

providing an external funding source when a firm fails or disappears. 

2.  Insurance  enforces  discipline.  Insurers  price  risk.  They  require  firms  to  implement 
compliance programs, reject known bad actors, and avoid risky behaviors that lead to claims. 
In effect, insurers act as a private market discipline mechanism. 

3.  Insurance is commonplace and feasible. States like Oregon and Oklahoma already require 
investment advisers to carry insurance. Major custodians like Schwab and Fidelity have also 
implemented insurance mandates for firms on their platforms. These requirements have not 
reduced access to financial advice, and the number of advisers in those jurisdictions increased 
post-implementation. 

4.  Disclosure aligns FINRA with the broader legal system. In federal court and nearly every 
state, parties must disclose the existence of insurance coverage. FINRA is an outlier in not 
requiring this. Allowing for confidential, non-evidentiary insurance disclosure in arbitration 
would promote fairness and efficiency. 

5.  The market supports implementation. Empirical data show that requiring even modest 
insurance coverage (e.g., $1 million per firm) does not drive professionals from the industry. 
If  anything,  mandatory  insurance  can  enhance  investor  trust  and  attract  more  business  to 
reputable, well-insured firms. 

Congress, North American Securities Administrators Association (NASAA), and the SEC 
have called on FINRA to address unpaid awards. Insurance as a solution. The tools exist and the 
path for implementation is clear. 

PIABA  urges  FINRA  to  act  decisively:  require  all  member  firms  to  carry  meaningful 
insurance and mandate disclosure of insurance coverage in FINRA arbitrations. Investors deserve a 
system that not only adjudicates claims but ensures justice is served.

VIII.  FINRA Members Using Holding Companies to Escape Liability 

FINRA  currently  permits  non-member  holding  companies  and  non-associated  persons 
(“Holding  Companies”)  to  own  FINRA  member  firms.  However,  because  these  Holding 
Companies are not themselves FINRA members, FINRA states that it lacks authority to directly 
regulate their conduct or to require them to participate in FINRA arbitration proceedings. This 
remains true even where the Holding Company owns 100% of the FINRA member, is listed as a 
“Control Person” on the member firm’s Form BD and exercises full operational control over the 
member’s activities. 

This situation presents a serious inconsistency. Under FINRA Rule 1011(b)(3), a Holding 
Company that controls a member firm meets the definition of an “associated person of a member.” 
Despite this definition, FINRA does not consistently assert jurisdiction over Holding Companies, 
and  when  it  does,  arbitration  panels  often  decline  to  enforce  that  jurisdiction.  In  other  cases, 
Holding Companies that are compelled to participate in FINRA arbitration may seek relief in court, 
including  temporary  restraining  orders,  to  avoid  arbitration  entirely.  These  tactics  disrupt  the 
FINRA arbitration process and undermine investor protection. 

This is a pressing problem with real-world consequences. In January and February 2025 
alone, millions of dollars in arbitration awards went unpaid due to the use of Holding Companies 
that  controlled  FINRA  members  but  were  not  themselves  subject  to  FINRA  oversight  or 
arbitration.  In  these  instances,  individuals  and  entities  that  own  and  control  FINRA  members 
continue to operate in the industry and benefit from their associations—while injured investors, 
including  elderly  and  vulnerable  individuals,  are  left  without  any  meaningful  opportunity  for 
recovery, even after spending years pursuing claims through FINRA arbitration. 

This gap in FINRA’s jurisdiction causes substantial harm: 

1.  Lack of Arbitrability – Investors are unable to bring claims against Holding Companies, 
even  when  those  companies  are  responsible  for  the  conduct  or  solvency  of  the  FINRA 
member. 

2.  Lack  of  Regulatory  Oversight  –  FINRA  has  no  effective  authority  to  supervise  or 
sanction misconduct by Holding Companies, despite their control over regulated member 
firms. 

3.  Avoidance  of  Liability  –  Holding  Companies  can  avoid  paying  arbitration  awards  by 
closing broker-dealer subsidiaries with large liabilities and shifting operations to affiliated 
entities. 

This problem arises from deliberate corporate structuring designed to avoid accountability, 
and FINRA’s current rules do not adequately address it. The result is a regulatory framework that 
allows responsible parties to benefit from FINRA membership while avoiding the obligations that 
should accompany that status. 

PIABA urges FINRA to revise its rules to close this gap. Specifically, FINRA should: 

9 

 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
1.  Require any individual or entity that owns or controls a FINRA member firm to submit to 

FINRA jurisdiction; 

2.  Mandate  that  Holding  Companies  and  control  persons  participate  in  FINRA  arbitration 

under Rule 12200, where they are alleged to have responsibility for investor harm; 

3.  Prohibit associated persons, owners, and control entities from remaining in the industry if 

they are affiliated with firms that fail to pay arbitration awards. 

These reforms are necessary to protect investors and to ensure that FINRA arbitration remains a 
fair, effective, and enforceable dispute resolution process. 

IX. PIABA’s Concerns Regarding FINRA’s Unilateral Changes to Arbitrator 
Qualifications 

PIABA  is  deeply  concerned  by  FINRA’s  recent,  sweeping  changes  to  arbitrator 
qualification  standards  —  changes  that  were  implemented  without  public  notice,  meaningful 
consultation, or adherence to FINRA’s historically transparent and consensus-driven rulemaking 
process  through  the  National  Arbitration  and  Mediation  Committee  (NAMC).  These  abrupt 
departures from long-standing practice will likely shrink the arbitrator pool, introduce procedural 
inefficiencies, and ultimately harm investors seeking redress through the arbitration forum. 

Historically, FINRA (and previously NASD) maintained arbitrator qualification standards 
that  balanced  educational  achievement  with  real-world  experience.  For  example,  the NASD 
Arbitrator Application Booklet (March 2003)permitted candidates with two years of college-
level coursework and five years of business or professional experience, including an exception for 
those without college credits, but with substantial relevant experience. FINRA’s new standard now 
mandates  a  four-year  college  degree  and  restricts  eligibility  to  individuals  with  “professional” 
work experience — narrowing the pipeline of qualified applicants and excluding many capable 
candidates,  including  small  business  owners  and  others  with  decades  of  meaningful  practical 
experience. 

This change risks severely limiting the availability of arbitrators, particularly in small and 
mid-size cities where the pool is already thin. As a result, FINRA is likely to rely even more heavily 
on “traveling” arbitrators — those assigned to cases far from their home jurisdictions — which 
increases  scheduling  conflicts  and  delays.  PIABA  has  long  expressed  concerns  that  such 
arbitrators, especially repeat participants, may be more prone to industry bias and less reflective 
of the diverse perspectives necessary for a truly fair forum. 

PIABA  supports  efforts  to  diversify  and  improve  the  quality  of  the  arbitrator  pool. 
However, raising educational and professional barriers in this way is counterproductive. Unlike 
juries in state or federal courts, FINRA arbitrators are now subject to stricter qualifications than 
jurors or even licensed financial professionals. For example, no college degree is required to sit 
for the Series 7 exam or become a financial advisor. It is unreasonable to assume that individuals 
without a college degree cannot effectively grasp or adjudicate the types of issues that arise in 

10 

 
 
 
 
  
  
  
  
securities arbitration. Arbitrators with significant life, business, and community experience — yet 
who may not hold a degree — can offer invaluable insights and fairness to the process. 

The fairness of FINRA arbitration is already a topic of concern, particularly given that the 
industry prevails in roughly 70% of customer cases, and nearly one-third of awards go unpaid. 
Instead  of  addressing  these  systemic  imbalances,  FINRA’s  changes  appear  to  further  tilt  the 
process in favor of the industry — without input from the investing public or the broader arbitration 
community. 

For these reasons, PIABA urges FINRA to: immediately halt implementation of the new 
qualification  standards;  open  a  public  comment  period  to  gather  feedback  from  stakeholders; 
reassess the changes through the transparent NAMC process; and focus on reforms that broaden, 
rather than narrow, access to a diverse and capable arbitrator pool. 

Investors deserve a fair forum. Procedural shortcuts and exclusionary policies undermine 

that goal. FINRA must do better. 

CONCLUSION 

In sum, PIABA supports a variety of common-sense amendments and improvements that 
will  enhance  investor  protection,  but  PIABA  encourages  FINRA  to  ensure  that  any  considered 
changes would prioritize the strengthening of investor protection and integrity of the markets. We 
urge FINRA to issue specific, enforceable guidance affirming that technological convenience must 
not come at the expense of investor protection. The core principles of fairness, transparency, and 
acting in the customer’s best interest must remain intact and be upheld regardless of changes in 
technological advancements. PIABA looks forward to the opportunity to comment on any future 
proposals.

THE INSURANCE SOLUTION FOR FINANCIAL ADVICE FAILURES 

ADAM J. GANA AND BENJAMIN P. EDWARDS1 

ABSTRACT 

Solving the retirement savings crisis requires widespread access to reliable financial advice.  Yet 
financial advisers now often operate without insurance, collecting fees and commissions from 
customers  and  leaving  them  penniless  when  substandard  advice  causes  harm.    Instituting 
insurance coverage requirements would provide protection for investors and allow market forces 
to discipline misconduct.  For decades, advocates and regulators have raised awareness about 
the millions of unpaid arbitration awards each year; an insurance solution would greatly reduce 
the harm suffered.   

This essay aims to create a roadmap to solve the problem.  It identifies the problem and maps 
out the different levers available to policymakers to increase overall insurance coverage across a 
fragmented regulatory landscape.

I.  INTRODUCTION AND BACKGROUND 

Investors wronged by wealth management firms often find themselves 
unable to recover.  For example, Bruce Wilkerson reached the Super Bowl as an 
offensive tackle for the Green Bay Packers in 1996.2  After he left the National 
Football League, having played for the Packers, Jaguars, and Raiders, he worked 
as  a  machinist  and  trusted  Resource  Horizons  Group,  a  brokerage  firm,  to 
manage the wealth he earned by putting his body on the line.3  After one of the 
brokerage’s registered representatives ran a Ponzi scheme, an arbitration within 
the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority’s (“FINRA”) Dispute Resolution 
Forum  found  Resource  Horizons  Group  liable  for  over  $600,000  in 
compensatory  damages  and  another  $1.4  million  in  damages  under  the 
Tennessee  Consumer  Protection  Act. 4   Yet  Wilkerson  would  never  see  any 
recovery because Resource Horizons Group closed its doors without insurance 
to cover Wilkerson’s claim.5 

For decades, bottom-tier financial services firms have profited by selling 
high-commission products only to fold once claims for abusive sales practices 
arrive.6  In 2000, the Government Accountability Office found that nearly two-
thirds  of  arbitration  awards  against  stockbrokers  and  brokerage  firms  went 
unpaid.7 Often,  the  brokers  involved  scurry  from  one  brokerage  to  another, 
continuing to exploit investors.  This occurs so often that some use the term 
“cockroaching”  to  describe  “brokers  moving  from  one  problem  firm  to

another.”8  Financial advisers will sometimes even shift from selling securities 
to other financial products simply to evade federal oversight.9 

Wall Street’s deadbeat firms come in different varieties.  Some operate 
as FINRA-supervised brokerage firms,10 generally selling securities in exchange 
for transaction-based compensation.11 Others operate as registered investment 
advisory firms, generally receiving compensation directly for investment advice 
about securities.12  Often, firms and individuals will operate under both regimes 
simultaneously, with their duties and obligations shifting depending on the hat 
worn at the time.13  Adding to the complexity, many financial advisers also sell 
insurance products under lax state regulation and supervision.14  

In recent years, business models have shifted, with more brokers and 
brokerage firms shifting to operate as investment advisers.15  Private equity firms 
have  accelerated  this  move  by  acquiring  investment  advisory  firms  for  their 
predictable cash flows and growth.16 

Both brokerage and advisory firms often operate without any insurance 
and leave investors unable to recover if problems arise.17  Although the unpaid 
award problem has been extensively studied and documented in the brokerage

context, 18  the  problem  extends  beyond  brokerages.    NASAA  enforcement 
reports show that both investment advisors and brokers regularly misbehave.19 

After  decades  of  harm,  federal  policymakers  have  taken  notice  and 
demanded action.  The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC or the 
“Commission”)  Investor  Advocate  recently  called  for  investment  advisers  to 
disclose more information to better understand the scope of the problem in the 
advisory context.20  Congress has also begun applying pressure for FINRA to 
take  action  to  address  the  problem  in  the  broker-dealer  space.    The  Senate 
Committee  on  Appropriations  recently  found  that  “FINRA  has  failed  to 
undertake  steps  to  address  unpaid  arbitration  awards  by  its  members.”21   It 
directed that the “SEC shall continue to engage with FINRA to identify ways to 
reduce and eliminate the occurrence of unpaid awards.”22 

Despite this problem persisting for decades and leaving investors with 
enormous  losses,  a  solution  to  dramatically  mitigate  the  problem  exists—
insurance.    In  this  context,  insurance  requirements  offer  two  major  benefits.  
First, insurance companies may force brokerages and advisory firms to adopt 
better practices to maintain coverage at favorable rates.  Second, a reasonable 
degree of insurance will allow more investors to recover in instances when and 
if  harm  arrives.    Notably,  this  insurance  solution  does  not  guarantee  that  all 
investors  will  recover  every  dime  in  every  instance  of  misconduct.    Yet,  an 
industry carrying insurance offers investors substantially better protection than 
an industry without it. 

The  states  have  taken  some  action  to  improve  insurance  coverage.  
Notably, two states—Oregon and Oklahoma—have already moved to require 
some wealth management firms to carry insurance.23  Their requirements offer 
some  lessons  for  a  broader  insurance  mandate.    At  a  minimum,  the  existing 
numbers  in  the  aftermath  of  this  natural  experiment  indicate  that  creating 
modest insurance requirements does not lead to any material reduction in the

availability of financial advice for main street investors.24  However, the existing 
insurance requirements only reach a portion of the wealth management firms 
operating within those jurisdictions.25  

This essay aims to explore the critical need for insurance and provide 
guidance  for  how  to  require  insurance  across  a  fragmented  financial  advice 
industry.26 Part II discusses the imperfect existing insurance requirements and 
errors and omissions insurance marketplace available today.  Part III frames the 
elements  of  a  successful  insurance  program  and  overviews  the  regulatory 
mechanisms for instituting insurance requirements. 

II. 

EXISTING INSURANCE REQUIREMENTS ARE IMPERFECT 

At present, state and federal law says little about insurance requirements 
for  wealth  management  firms.27   As  financial  advisers  may  be  supervised  by 
FINRA, state securities regulators, state insurance regulators, the SEC, or some 
combination of the foregoing, requiring coverage across the industry will require 
coordinated action from an array of regulators.   

Fragmented  and  overlapping  regulation  may  partially  explain  the 
inaction when it comes to mandatory insurance.  For example, if FINRA moved 
first and mandated that brokerage firms carry insurance, it might place brokerage 
firms  at  a  competitive  disadvantage  to  state  and  SEC-registered  investment 
advisory firms. The same may be true if the states or SEC acted first.  

Despite the pressure toward inaction, some insurance requirements have 
emerged  and  merit  consideration  at  the  state  level  and  from  clearing  firms.28  
Critically, current evidence indicates that insurance requirements, as currently 
implemented, do not appear to meaningfully alter the public’s ability to access 
investment advice.29 

A. 

Limited Existing State Insurance Mandates  
Have Not Reduced Access to Investment Advice 

Many  financial  advisers  now  practice  without  insurance  or  enough 
insurance  to  cover  liability. 30    Currently,  only  two  states—Oregon  and

Oklahoma—require some financial advisers to carry some professional liability 
insurance  for  errors  and  omissions.  Yet  both  have  exemptions  for  broker-
dealers, relying on FINRA to fill the regulatory gap—an invitation FINRA has 
yet to accept.31 

In 2018, Oregon began requiring all state-registered investment advisers 
to carry at least $1 million in errors and omissions insurance.32 The $1 million 
requirement applies to all firms regardless of size, capturing intra-state brokerage 
operations and state-registered investment advisers.33 

Oregon’s  requirement  does  not  capture  all  investment  advisers 
operating in the state because Oregon only oversees a portion of the market.  
Investment  advisers  may  register  with  the  SEC  when  their  regulatory  assets 
under  management  reach  $100  million  or  more. 34   At  that  point,  the  SEC 
oversees their operations instead of the state.35 

Oregon’s flat $1 million coverage requirement may generate a degree of 
inequity  among  financial  firms.    For  example,  under  Oregon’s  statute,  a  firm 
with  $6  million  in  assets  under  management  has  the  same  insurance 
requirements as a firm with $96 million in assets under management.36  To the 
extent that policies cost approximately the same, firms with smaller assets under 
management will pay a higher relative cost than firms with more assets.  The 
requirement may also create an incentive for smaller advisory firms to merge 
with  larger  firms  to  reduce  costs  or  entirely  avoid  Oregon’s  insurance 
requirement by transitioning to SEC oversight. 

When Oklahoma followed Oregon’s lead in 2020 with an administrative 
rule  requiring  state  investment  advisers  to  carry  $1  million  in  errors  and 
omissions  insurance,  it  too  missed  the  opportunity  to  provide  a  tailored 
coverage  requirement. 37    Notwithstanding  the  gaps  in  coverage,  the  laws 
increase investor protection in both states to this day.38 

Although the insurance mandate itself is simple, both states worked to 
facilitate compliance.  To make sure that all licensees can access the coverage 
they need, Oregon and Oklahoma both admitted surplus line insurers and risk

retention and purchasing groups into the state.39  In Oregon, licensees simply 
submit annual proof of insurance.40 Firms that fail to submit proof of insurance 
risk having their licenses canceled.41  

B. 

Industry Insurance Requirements 

Some  financial  advisers  carry  insurance  because  some  custodial 
platforms insist on insurance for advisers using their platforms.42  For example, 
in 2021, Charles Schwab & Co. (“Schwab”) launched a program to eventually 
require all Registered Investment Advisers (“RIA”) using its custodial services 
to  carry  at  least  $1  million  in  insurance,  including  errors  and  omissions 
coverage.43 Like Oregon and Oklahoma, Schwab undertook measures to ensure 
that  the  insurance  market  could  accommodate  the  new  rule,  which  included 
working  with  insurance  companies  to  obtain  preferred  pricing  for  Schwab’s 
clients.44  

RIA  firms  voluntarily  elected  to  comply  with  Schwab’s  insurance 
requirement instead of seeking a different custodial platform.  Unlike the states, 
where in-state advisers had to comply or lose their licenses, Schwab’s users could 
have readily chosen to shift to a different custodial platform because none of 
Schwab’s competitors imposed similar requirements.45  

Instituting the insurance requirement did not reduce Schwab’s market 
share.  Despite 2022 being one of the worst-performing years for stocks and 
bonds in history, Schwab’s net income still increased after mandating insurance, 
and Schwab saw rapid RIA growth in 2023.46

Schwab’s insurance requirement may provide it with a range of benefits.  
In instances where a claimant names Schwab as a defendant alongside an advisor 
using its platform, Schwab may now be readily assured that the RIA firm will 
have coverage and counsel—potentially mitigating Schwab’s costs. 

Schwab’s insurance requirement may also provide a filtering mechanism 
for uninsurable firms.  To the extent that any RIA firm cannot obtain insurance 
because of risks unique to that RIA firm, Schwab likely benefits by excluding 
the firm from its platform.  Thus, the insurance requirement may allow Schwab 
to use insurance companies to exclude firms that would draw the most litigation 
and attendant problems for Schwab from its platform. 

Despite  Schwab’s  influence  in  the  marketplace,  private  insurance 
requirements have not yet proliferated and changed broader industry practice.47  
Financial  advisers  often  operate  without  insurance,  and  other  custodial 
platforms do not require firms to maintain insurance. 

C. 

Existing Insurance Disclosure Requirements 

Insurance  disclosure  requirements  might  also  play  a  role  in  investor 
protection.    Knowledge  of  insurance  coverage  can  influence  an  investor’s 
behavior,  such  as  whether  to  work  with  an  adviser  and  whether  and  how  to 
pursue  a  claim  if  the  adviser  causes  harm.    Yet,  as  it  stands,  investors  are 
generally poorly situated to evaluate insurance information and often lack access 
to basic information about a financial adviser’s insurance.48   

1.  Kansas Insurance Disclosure Requirement 

In 2012, Kansas began requiring investment advisers to disclose their 
professional liability insurance status to all current and prospective clients.49 In 
theory,  requiring  investment  advisers  to  disclose  their  professional  liability 
insurance information allows clients to take this information into account when 
deciding  between  firms. 50  A  disclosure  requirement  may  even  drive  some 
financial  advisers  to  obtain  insurance  to  avoid  disclosing  that  they  operate 
without insurance. 

Securities  law  often  defaults  to  a  disclosure-oriented  model  because 
disclosure plays such a critical role in both the market and the SEC’s regulation

of public company disclosures.51  Yet disclosure-oriented rules may not achieve 
investor  protection  goals  in  this  context  because  many  people  work  with 
financial  advisers  because  they  desire  informed  guidance.    Unlike  public 
company disclosures, no market price transmits information about a financial 
adviser  in  real-time  to  other  persons  seeking  information  about  the  financial 
adviser. 52    No  market  mechanism  makes  uninformed  investors  aware  that 
sophisticated investors have shunned advisers without insurance.53  

In  this  context,  disclosure  requirements  may  even  expose  the  least 
sophisticated investors to greater risks.  If some relatively sophisticated clients 
alert to risks and leave the adviser, the remaining clients likely face greater peril 
because  the  advisor  still  needs  to  pay  bills  and  must  now  generate  the  same 
income from a shrinking client base.  Unscrupulous advisers may opt to make 
up the difference by exploiting investors. 

Kansas’s disclosure requirements may be most useful for investors after 
harm  occurs.    Because  Kansas  firms  must  disclose  their  insurance  status, 
investors who have suffered harm can take insurance information into account 
when deciding whether to pursue relief.54 

2.  Limited Access to Insurance Coverage Information 

Despite  Kansas’s  requirement,  insurance  coverage  information  often 
remains  a  closely  guarded  secret.    In  contrast  to  ordinary  litigation,  FINRA 
arbitration  does  not  require  its  members  to  produce  information  about 
insurance coverage in arbitration.55  FINRA’s current discovery guide does not 
require brokers to provide information about any insurance coverage they may 
have.56 As a result, investors may pursue actions against uninsured brokers who 
cannot afford to pay claims.57  In contrast, the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure 
mandate parties to disclose insurance coverage.58 

51  See Troy A. Paredes, Blinded by the Light: Information Overload and Its Consequences 
for Securities Regulation, 81 WASH. L.Q. 417, 418 (2003) (“Securities regulation is 
motivated, in large part, by the assumption that more information is better than less. 
Perhaps this is no surprise since the SEC's chief regulatory tool is to require companies to 
disclose more.”).

uninsured brokerages incapable of paying damages.64

Marketplace Impacts from Insurance Requirements 

To forestall any regulation, the financial advice industry will sometimes 
argue that raising standards would hurt the public because it would reduce their 
access  to  financial  advice.    Opponents  of  mandatory  insurance  contend  that 
insurance requirements would do more harm than good by reducing the public’s 
ability to find financial advice.  Yet the best available evidence indicates that this 
simply is not true. 

Consider  how  advice  markets  reacted  to  the  introduction  of  existing 
insurance  requirements.    After  implementing  errors  &  omissions  insurance 
mandates, Oregon and Oklahoma did not experience a reduction in financial 
advisory services.65 In fact, after the mandates became effective in each state, the 
number of investment advisers increased and did not fall relative to other states 
without a mandate.66 An in-depth study of the number of investment advisers 
in  Oregon  and  Oklahoma  before  and  after  the  mandates  introduction  shows

that  the  insurance  requirements  had  no  material  effect  on  the  number  of 
financial advisers in either state.67 

Although the benefit to the public will be significant, industry insurance 
costs  appear  low  relative  to  the  profitability  of  financial  advice  firms.    After 
Schwab’s  insurance  requirement  for  investment  advisors,  the  number  of 
advisors  using  Schwab’s  custodial  services  also  increased  despite  a  severe 
economic downturn.68  

Despite  the  marginal  cost,  insurance  requirements  may  increase  the 
volume of financial advice business.  More widespread insurance requirements 
could  drive  demand  by  making  the  industry  easier  to  trust.    With  insurance 
behind the industry, more members of the public may work with advisers. 

III.  A FRAMEWORK TO IMPROVE INSURANCE COVERAGE 

Widespread insurance coverage would likely benefit both investors and 
financial  professionals.    Investors  would  more  often  recover  damages  in 
instances  of  misconduct  and  benefit  from  any  risk  reductions  generated  by 
insurance company requirements.  Responsible financial firms already carrying 
insurance would no longer operate against competitors without insurance.  

A. 

Elements of A Successful Insurance Program 

Successful  insurance  reforms  should  aim  to  achieve  some  core 
objectives.  We propose three here: (1) ensuring appropriate coverage amounts 
and terms for firm size; (2) generating functioning markets that price risk and 
reduce misconduct; and (3) providing information about coverage. 

1.  Appropriate Coverage Amounts and Terms 

for Firm Size and Characteristics 

Although  one-size-fits-all  insurance  coverage  requirements  do  some 
good by mandating coverage, they also generate problems.  A per claim two-
million-dollar coverage requirement will be too small for some firms and too 
large and expensive for others.  Rather, insurance requirements must consider 
the  size  of  the  firm  and  provide  coverage  requirements  proportional  to  the 
amount  of  risk  that  a  firm  imposes  on  the  public.    Appropriately  tailored 
insurance  requirements  would  ensure  adequate  coverage  without  imposing 
undue costs on financial services firms. 

Insurance  coverage  requirements  should  increase  with  a  firm’s  assets 
under management.  Tying a firm’s insurance level to its asset level ensures that 
it will be able to afford appropriate coverage.  One simple solution would be to

require firms to maintain the greater of either (1) a million dollars in coverage 
or (2) insurance coverage equivalent to 2% of assets under management.  This 
would mean that a firm with $99 million in client assets would need just under 
$2 million in coverage.  In contrast, a firm with only $15 million in assets would 
only need to carry a million in coverage.69 

Regulators  crafting  insurance  requirements  should  also  ensure  that 
policy  terms  do  not  render  protective  benefits  illusory.    For  example,  a  firm 
might acquire coverage with a high per-incident deductible.  Functionally, these 
policies mean that insurance funds will only become available for a claim after 
the deductible has been met and each claim must meet its own deductible before 
tapping into coverage.  If the insurance policy only applied after the firm spent 
more than $250,000 in costs for defense, a firm facing five or six claims arising 
out of selling a toxic financial product to investors might face up-front costs 
greater than the insurance policy’s coverage amount and simply opt to go out of 
business. 

This  does  not  mean  that  no  firms  should  be  able  to  use  higher-
deductible  coverage.    A  regulatory  response  here  should  aim  to  preserve 
flexibility  while  ensuring  that  insurance  coverage  improves  outcomes.  One 
solution to this problem would be to require firms using high-deductible policies 
to  hold  cash  or  other  high-quality  assets  equivalent  to  their  insurance 
deductibles.   

Here, risk does not always scale uniformly between firms.  Some firms 
pose heightened risks to the public and might benefit from additional coverage.  
For  example,  FINRA  internally  designates  certain  firms  as  “restricted”  and 
selects them for a higher degree of oversight because of the risks their operations 
pose to the public.70  Although FINRA does not currently require these firms to 
carry any insurance, a uniform insurance requirement would do enormous good 
simply by ensuring that these toxic firms carried insurance as well. 

69  Tying the insurance requirement to a firm’s asset level avoids the need to index for 
inflation or make other changes.  As the firms grow, their insurance should grow with 
them.

2.  Functioning Insurance Markets  

Price Risk And Reduce Misconduct 

Insurance coverage requirements may generate a range of benefits.  At 
the  outset,  coverage  requirements  may  reduce  prices  for  insured  firms  by 
mandating participation.  By requiring all firms to procure insurance, risk pools 
expand—allowing  insurance  companies  to  offer  coverage  at  lower  prices 
through economies of scale.   

Well-functioning insurance markets also spread risk across firms.  Firms 
hiring financial advisers may not always be able to determine which advisers will 
generate liability and which ones will not.71  By requiring the entire industry to 
maintain insurance, the cost of financial adviser misconduct gets spread across 
many different firms. 

Yet insurance requirements offer another benefit—the ability to price 
and  limit  known  risks.    To  the  extent  that  certain  firms  or  individuals  pose 
greater risks to the public—insurance companies now use that information to 
price their coverage. 72  Since insurance companies charge more for hiring these 
high-risk individuals, an insurance requirement may disincentivize firms from 
hiring  them  or,  at  minimum,  spread  the  risk  of  their  bad  behavior.  These 
coverage  requirements  also  force  riskier  firms  to  internalize  the  risk  their 
operations create.   

For insurance to provide the most benefit, it must cover every financial 
adviser working with the public.  At present, some insurance companies write 
policies for financial services firms that exclude specific financial advisers from 
coverage because of identified risks associated with the individual.73  This creates 
a gap in coverage for those most likely to create harm.74  

Requiring firms to procure coverage for these higher-risk advisers would 
generate real benefits.  To the extent that a particular financial adviser is too 
costly to insure, the insurance market may protect the public more swiftly than 
a regulatory bar by excluding the individual from the industry.  

3.  Insurance Disclosure 

Insurance disclosure requirements may also ensure that investors benefit 
from coverage. A good disclosure rule would require all investment advisors and 

71  Pricing financial adviser risk may be challenging because of how much complaint data 
has been expunged from public records.  See Benjamin P. Edwards, Adversarial Failure, 
77 WASH. & LEE L. REV. 1053 (2020) (detailing how a flawed expungement process led to 
the deletion of public records about complaints against financial advisers). 
72  See NASAA, supra note 17, at 6 (“[I]n general, a firm may reduce the cost of its policy 
by excluding a high risk representative from coverage”).

broker-dealers to disclose to current and prospective clients information about 
insurance coverage and provide their current and prospective clients with a copy 
of  their  policy  upon  request. 75    Although  this  will  not  ensure  that  every 
meritorious claim will be paid, it could keep many harmed investors from going 
deeper into the hole by pursuing claims against firms unable to pay an award.76 

Disclosure requirements would also allow more sophisticated investors 
to select financial advisers with greater coverage.  This would allow the market 
to  reward  financial  advisers  for  carrying  additional  insurance.    Although  this 
solution would not do much to help unsophisticated clients ex-ante, they would 
be better able to assess their options ex-post should a claim arise.  

B. 

Possible Implementation Sources

appears clear, no single regulator now possesses the power to mandate insurance 
across the market.  Rather, a range of different overlapping state, federal, and 
self-regulatory  organizations  must

1.  Uniform State Legislation or Regulation 

At the outset, states retain substantial influence over financial regulation 
and  directly  regulate  a  subset  of  investment  advisers  and  brokerage  firms.77 
Although states sometimes chart their own course on securities law issues, they 
often  adopt  model  legislation  and  regulations  promulgated  by  the  North 
American Securities Administrator’s Association.  (“NASAA”).78  Nevada, for 
example, even explicitly statutorily directs its state securities regulator to consult 
NASAA’s model regulations when crafting rules.79 

By acting through NASAA and generating uniform insurance legislation 
and regulations, state securities regulators can increase the odds states will enact

insurance requirements covering a significant portion of the industry.  Uniform 
regulation  also  offers  an  additional  benefit—when  states  take  the  same 
approach,  it  minimizes  the  burden  for  firms  operating  across  multiple  state 
jurisdictions. 

NASAA  has  succeeded  in  generating  widespread  investor  protection 
reforms  in  the  past.    For  example,  its  model  legislation  to  protect  vulnerable 
adults from exploitation has been adopted in most states.80  NASAA adopted 
the model legislation in 2016, and most states have enacted it in one form or 
another,  providing  substantially  greater  protection  to  vulnerable  adults  in 
adopting states.  

2.  Securities and Exchange Commission Action 

The  SEC  may  act  to  impose  insurance  requirements  directly  on 
registered  investment  advisers  and  indirectly  for  brokerage  firms. 81    The 
Commission has direct regulatory authority over registered investment advisers 
with over $100 million in assets under management.82  It also enjoys a degree of 
direct  authority  over  brokerage  firms  and  substantial  flexibility  through  its 
oversight of the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority.83  

In an ideal world, all investment advisers and broker-dealers should be 
required to maintain an errors and omissions insurance policy or policies in the 
aggregate  amount  of  at  least  two  percent  of  assets  under  management  as  a 
condition of SEC registration.  Yet the road to this goal may be complicated 
because the Supreme Court recently weakened administrative agencies power to 
regulate. 84  Under  new  precedent,  courts  no  longer  defer  as  much  to 
administrative  agencies 
interpreting  and  applying  somewhat  ambiguous 
statutes.85  This does not mean that the SEC should stand idle for fear of some 
possible challenge.

registration.86  Although the law does not explicitly grant the Commission the 
power to impose an insurance requirement, the Commission would be within 
its authority to deem carrying insurance “necessary or appropriate in the public 
interest or for the protection of investors.”87 

In  the  alternative,  the  Commission  might  use  its  power  to  regulate 
arbitration agreements to impose a coverage requirement.  Dodd-Frank gave the 
SEC  the  power  to  impose  conditions  on  arbitration  agreements. 88 Congress 
explicitly  authorized  it  to  “impose  conditions  or  limitations”  on  arbitration 
agreements  “if  it  finds  that  such  prohibition,  imposition  of  conditions,  or 
limitations are in the public interest and for the protection of investors.”89  As 
these  arbitration  agreements  often  impose  significant  costs  on  investors,  the 
SEC may require firms to maintain an insurance backstop ensuring some ability 
to pay before forcing investors into a costly dispute resolution forum. 

At  the  same  time,  the  Commission  might  also  require  investment 
advisers  to  make  disclosures  about  their  insurance  coverage.90   Although  this 
power would not allow it to impose a mandate to purchase insurance, it would 
force firms to notify their clients about their insurance coverage.   

The Commission might simultaneously adopt a severable coverage and 
disclosure requirement to address the risk that a federal court would deem the 
insurance requirement beyond the scope of the Commission’s authority.   

b.  Brokerage Oversight 

Brokerage  regulation  may  be  more  flexible  because  FINRA,  an 
ostensibly private entity, serves as the primary regulator for brokerages under 
SEC  supervision. 91    At  present,  FINRA  does  not  need  congressional 
authorization  to  make  investor  protection  rules.92   Rather,  the  self-regulatory 

86  See § 15 U.S.C.A. 80b-3(c)(1) (West) (“An investment adviser. . . may be registered by

organization could simply impose an insurance requirement as a condition of 
membership.93 

FINRA also enjoys the power to solve disclosure problems.  It maintains 
a “discovery guide” to facilitate disclosures in securities arbitration.94  FINRA 
could ensure insurance disclosure as well by simply finalizing the disclosure rule 
it considered in 2018.95   

As the federal regulator overseeing FINRA, the SEC enjoys power to 
cause  FINRA  to  amend  its  rules.    It  could  do  so  informally  through  moral 
suasion or explicitly though its power to amend FINRA’s rules.96 

Although the primary regulator for brokerage firms, FINRA could also 
use its authority to improve investment adviser conduct.  Investment advisers 
generally custody assets through FINRA brokerage firms.  FINRA could require 
that  brokerage  firms  only  allow  third  parties  such  as  investment  advisers  to 
manage  securities  accounts  for  others  if  they  maintain  appropriate  insurance.  
Indeed, as explained above, Schwab has already taken this approach on its own 
initiative. 

IV. 

CONCLUSION 

Ultimately, the need for widespread insurance remains clear.  Until now, 
financial services firms have largely succeeded at externalizing the cost of bad 
financial advice while keeping the profits for themselves.  Insurance solves for 
some of this problem by causing the industry to internalize some of the costs 
created by misconduct. 

This  essay  charts  a  path  for  improving  insurance  coverage  across  a 
financial advice market governed by a broad coalition of regulators.  Although 
the available tools to impose insurance requirements will differ depending on 
the regulatory actor, the need remains urgent across the market. 

93 To  its  credit,  FINRA  has  taken  some  measures  to  cause  brokerage  firms  known  to  pose 
heightened risks to keep more cash on hand to protect future creditors. See FINRA Rule 4111, 
Restricted  Firm  Obligations.    These  requirements  would  be  more  effective  alongside 
insurance.

Subject: FINRA Regulatory Notice 25-04 

Dear Ms. Mitchell,  

The American Council of Life Insurers appreciates the opportunity to offer comments and 
feedback on FINRA’s efforts to launch a broad review to modernize rules regarding member firms 
and associated persons. We have responses to the following questions raised in the request.  

Request for Comment 

1.  What specific FINRA rules should be a focus for modernization based on their economic costs 
and benefits; changes in markets, products, services, or technology; or otherwise? What 
groups of FINRA requirements should be a focus? Please include FINRA rules that may be 
mandated or derived from a statutory or other non-FINRA regulatory requirement applicable to 
FINRA or its members. 

ACLI broadly supports FINRA’s efforts to modernize and streamline rules. We ask that FINRA 
consider a tiered regulatory framework for advertising rules that account for business model 
differences among insurers. This framework could include providing more deference to state

insurance regulatory oversight for insurers that offer primarily insurance-only products with limited 
investment product offerings while maintaining more FINRA oversight of insurers that offer more 
retirement solution-based products. In addition, FINRA should consider applying different 
standards for retail-facing v. institutional-only insurers. Applying the same standards for retail-
facing and institutional-only firms creates inefficiencies without clear investor benefits.  

A tiered regulatory framework could streamline FINRA’s review process. This efficiency is 
necessary for consumers as they will receive their disclosures and products without any delay. 

Right now, the insurance regulatory framework provides supervision over advertising for annuities 
and insurance products.1 ACLI is committed to providing more specific information on this 
framework and welcomes opportunities to further engage with FINRA.  

Additionally, ACLI notes that the industry is seeing inconsistencies in the marketing rule guidance 
and audits applicable to Registered Index-Linked Annuities (RILAs). For example, the advertising 
rules applicable to RILAs are borrowed from Variable Universal Life Products (VULs). At the same 
time, FINRA audits have applied the Variable Annuity rules rather than the VUL rules to RILAs.  

Beyond marketing rules, ACLI would like to encourage the incorporation of deference to state 
insurance regulators when appropriate given the latest developments pertaining to NAIC’s Best 
Interest Model which is similar to Regulation Best Interest2 At a minimum, FINRA should review 
developments in the life insurance industry and evaluate if changes could be made to provide 
appropriate deference and reduce duplicity for insurance producers working under a registered 
firm. ACLI member companies are willing to share and discuss with FINRA additional information 
on areas of compliance that overlap with the regulatory regimes.  

4.  Are there gaps, risks or other challenges created by changes in markets, products, services or 
technology where additional guidance or standards would better enable member firms to 
serve investors, consistent with investor protection and market integrity? 

ACLI suggests that FINRA expand the CAB rules (discussed in FINRA Regulatory Notice 25-06) to 
apply to wholesale broker-dealers. Expanding these rules would reduce regulatory burdens along 
the distribution chain for life insurers.  

5.  Where does FINRA’s oversight of its member firms interact with other non-FINRA regulatory 

requirements in a manner that should be a focus for modernization, based on unnecessary or 
duplicative burdens, insufficiently tailored requirements, member firm or investor confusion, or 
otherwise? For example, what differences between FINRA’s requirements for broker-dealers 
and the requirements that apply for investment advisers engaging in similar activities should 
be a focus for modernization? 

As we indicated in our response to question 1, we encourage FINRA’s assessment of how the 
insurance industry’s requirements on insurance producers cover FINRA rules. We point out that 
the NAIC Best Interest Model provides deference to “comparable standards” which are defined to 
include the SEC’s Reg BI Rule.

We  appreciate  the  opportunity  to  comment  regarding  Rule  Modernization  as  discussed  in  Regulatory 
Notice 25-04. 

Our firm, Integrated Solutions, is a leading service provider within the financial industry, with a client base 
of  approximately  one  hundred  small  to  medium  sized  broker-dealers  that  are  involved  in  a  myriad  of 
business lines.  We are privileged to be able to offer guidance to our clients in a practical manner, which 
helps them navigate the multitude of rules to which they are subjected.  For those of us who have survived 
decades  upon  decades  of  supposed  improvement  to  the  securities  industry  and  supposed  increased 
investor protection, it appears for the most part that the regulators have complicated matters, increasing 
frustration among industry professionals and in doing so, having set forth rules and regulations that even 
the brightest of professionals and investors cannot grasp, nor wish to.   

This letter represents our own personal views and does not necessarily represent the views of any of our 
clients.    The  authors  of  this  letter  have  spent  many  decades  affiliating  with  the  broker-dealers  that 
constitute the membership of various exchanges or the only registered national securities association that 
currently is FINRA. 

As one gets older and experiences more of life and career, one realizes in most cases that is simpler and 
better to abide with the principles of KISS (keep it simple, stupid)! It is said that pendulum swings back 
and what we are waiting for is that swing. Too much regulation…yes! Too many nuances, gray areas, not 
justifiable or understandable regulation…yes! 

The treatment by FINRA of non-public personal information 

Let’s start with the most basic of learned kindergarten behavior. Do onto others as you would wish others 
to do onto you.  Our first observation about modernity is that the regulators regulating our industry are 
not subject to the same standards as we are. If we are to create an equal playing field between Regulators 
and Regulated then let the Association of our Members (FINRA) make some initial modernization changes.  
To begin with, we would like to request that the same protections that we are expected to afford our 
clients and investors, i.e., protection of their privacy and confidentiality, be afforded to Associated Persons 
of  a  broker-dealer.  We  would  like  FINRA  to  attest  that  all  of  the  personal  information  that  we  have 
provided to  FINRA on  the forms filed with  the Central Registration Depository that is administered by 
FINRA, including our height, weight, race, color of our eyes, hair, social security number, and residential 
history is fully protected. A regulator having all that sensitive information at its fingertips is a hotbed of 
temptation for identity theft and should provide the Associated Persons that it teaches to be protective 
of its clients, that it is pro-actively protective of their privacy.   While SEC Regulation S-P covers member 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
firms of FINRA, we wonder how the Central Registration Depository or any other agency that has possible 
access to these data, e.g. state regulators, FINRA, the SEC, or their employees, protects the privacy of the 
individuals whose personal information is available to them. 

Regulator personnel competency 

Next, let’s speak about equal footing in industry standards. Many of FINRA’s staff are professionals who 
have worked in the industry or for the SEC or another regulator. They have the experience to oversee 
regulated individuals. On the other hand, we have seen through our examination experiences that many 
do not have the experience or competence to pass judgment on a regulated firm’s efforts or practices 
related  to  its  compliance  with  even  basic  rules  or  regulations.  We  believe  that  a  good  modernization 
approach would be to expect that FINRA examiners be subject to the same qualification examinations as 
the people they regulate. It is unheard of for any other professional organization to have senior regulators 
who have not  passed  the minimum  examinations that  are  required of the persons they regulate.  For 
example, individuals constituting medical boards for physician oversight typically have met the minimum 
standards of that profession. Modernization means equalization. We are happy for trained professionals 
who  give  us  advice  and  guidance  based  upon  their  complete  understanding  of  the  financial  securities 
industry and qualified by the same standards.  It is our understanding that FINRA has not allowed persons 
who are not associated or proposed to be affiliated with a member firm to take and pass the standardized 
examinations administered by FINRA.  Obviously, were that prohibition to be lifted, the persons who pass 
the  examinations  should  be  allowed  to  retain  their  passed  examination  status  if  instead  of  being 
registered  with  a  FINRA  member,  they  are  employed  in  a  capacity  with  FINRA  or  a  similarly  situated 
regulator  where  they  utilize  on  a  regular  basis  the  competencies  that  are  proven  by  passing  such 
examinations. 

This point brings us to another issue of import, “Know Your Member.” Just as a Broker-Dealer is subject 
to FINRA Rule 2090 “Know Your Customer”, it is only appropriate that FINRA “Knows its Members.” It is 
understandable  that  a  FINRA  Member’s  first  examination  after  approval  is  a  “getting  to  know  you” 
moment, as it usually occurs after six months of membership.  The issue is that FINRA should have an 
individualized template utilized for each firm that it examines, as long as the member has not changed its 
business lines. This would indicate FINRA’s understanding of the inner workings of the client, which would 
avoid asking questions that are inappropriate to the business of the Firm. This would therefore save the 
efforts of not only the examiner, but as importantly, save the efforts of the Compliance Officer at a small 
firm, whose day is already complicated by trying to keep up with the multiple, extensive daily obligations 
for  which  they  are  responsible.    Streamlining  and  personalizing  the  examination  with  appropriate 
questions  that  indicate  that  FINRA  “Knows  its  Member”  will  ease  the  process  and  indicate  that  it  has 
performed its “due diligence” on their members. This would modernize the examination and make the 
process smoother for the examiner and the Member Firm.

Use it or lose it 

The five-year period  contained in the  MQP program is misguided. This  brings us to  another point.  We 
certainly  appreciate  the  efforts  that  FINRA  made  with  the  MQP  and  the  allowance  of  a  previously 
registered individual to maintain their licensing for 5 years as long as he or she participates in Continuing 
Education. That was a definite step in the right direction. Yet, it wasn’t a long enough road. Our doctors 
that  are  responsible  to  promote  our  health maintain  their  licensing  for  their  lifetimes  as  long  as  they 
participate  in  continuing  education  every  year.  The  same  goes  for  accountants,  lawyers,  and  other 
professionals. It is a way to keep well-trained, well-educated individuals in our field and their experience 
contributes to the well-being of the industry, no matter the period of timei.  

Mary Schapiro was right 

It’s always helpful to look backwards to move forwards. Those of us that are old enough to remember the 
days of dueling  rulebooks are  grateful that the NYSE and NASD recognized that two sets of rulebooks 
(especially  in  the  three-ring  binder  and  dividers  days  of  yore!)  were  absolutely  ludicrous  and  created 
conflicts for members of both regulatory organizations. Hence, the ultimate outcome was the creation of 
the consolidated rulebook and partial restoration of sanity for our industry.  With this in mind, let’s speak 
of  a  major  flaw  in  the  modernization  and  streamline  process…universality  of  laws,  rules,  documents 
required and the approval process.  We all know that the “good cop, bad cop” style of parenting isn’t 
recommended and doesn’t work. It is also a truism for an already overly burdened industry which can do 
so much better.  Blue Skies are beautiful, especially without a cloud in the sky. So should compliance with 
the  State  registration  process  and  the  simplification  of  State  securities  laws  to  require  uniformity  of 
requirements for registration in each State and eligibility for exemptions from registration.  Without this 
uniformity, it is almost a sure road to failure. Additional or supplemental information for certain states 
makes no sense, especially given the SEC and FINRA oversight of Broker-Dealers. It is unnecessary and 
duplicative and a waste of a Broker-Dealer’s resources.  Set a standard which is acceptable to the oversight 
and regulation of all of the Regulators and we will be happy to abide by it. Another clear example of the 
dichotomy  of  regulation  was  the  recent  enactment  by  FINRA  of  the  Residential  Supervisory  Location 
status. Here again, we have a standard set forth by FINRA as to what the criteria are for an “RSL,” but at 
the same time, certain states have not accepted the RSL criteria and require possible registration as a 
Branch  Office  given  their  individual  definitions.  Isn’t  that  a  waste  of  energy  and  common  sense  and 
confusing as well?  

Too many rules or regulations leads to less compliance 

Next, let’s speak about modernization of the FINRA rules. If FINRA and Regulators really desire compliance 
with rules and regulations, then they have to make them easier to read, digest and effectuate. When given 
the current presentation  of  rules,  our  eyes just gloss over after a few minutes and we effectively lose 
consciousness. Again, we bring in the concept of KISS. Create a “FINRA for Dummies” version of the rules 
and we will understand and abide by them. We remember the old days when rules were simplified and 
reflected the fact that we are professionals who are educated in their field through apprenticeship and 
licensing, and for the most part, are law abiding and conscientious. The more rules that are presented to 
licensed  individuals,  the  more  room  for  error.  In  addition,  our  clients,  our  investors,  do  not  read  our 
rulebooks (almost guaranteed), so the simpler it is for us, the simpler it is for them. In addition, we are 
Page 3 of 9 

 
 
 
  
well aware that most Associated Persons seldom read Written Supervisory Procedures especially if they 
are crafted by well-meaning compliance officials who are convinced that they can cover themselves by 
producing  very  extensive  manuals  that  contain  as  many  as  500  pages  of  writing  or  even  more. 
Standardization of most rules and procedures should be applied across the various venues.  Why not have 
universal laws as much as they can be applied, given the type of investor and the type of investment? Why 
cannot we have rules that are based on common sense and ease for the Broker-Dealer.  

A perfect example of how rules can be simplified can be applied to the Remote Pilot Inspection Program. 
The  question  is  why  is  the  program  even  a  “pilot  program”?  As  evidenced  through  several  years  of 
conducting business remotely during the Covid-19 pandemic, Broker-Dealers successfully demonstrated 
that they were capable of abiding by the rules and regulations of the industry without having a physical 
presence in an office. It is our opinion that there is no evidence that a physical inspection is any more 
effective than a remote one. In fact, FINRA itself performs remote inspections and has also been successful 
in doing so. Technologically  speaking,  both Regulators and Broker-Dealers have the capacity to surveil 
remotely. Has FINRA conducted any in-depth studies to analyze whether there are any additional benefits 
to an in-person inspection rather than a remote one? If Regulators are seeking to modernize, then this is 
one area that should be a given, not a “perhaps”. The fact is that more and more Broker-Dealers do not 
have  a  physical  presence  and  that  Associated  and  Registered  Persons  work  from  their  residences.   To 
accentuate our point, we were recently advised of the insistence of an SEC examiner who by the rule is 
required to perform a physical inspection in a Broker-Dealer’s first year, went to the official office space 
of the firm where no one physically works from.  A Registered Person who works from their residence, 
was required to go there to meet the examiner.  There was nothing to examine there that couldn’t have 
been examined remotely. Again, common sense would indicate that to see the physical office space of a 
firm, in which no one actually works proves nothing other than a physical address.  The two authors of 
this  letter  collectively  have  almost  100  years  of  experience  and  work  from  our  individual  residences. 
Would our expertise or compliance with the rules be any different if we worked from a physical office?   

Modernization  and  standardization  of  laws  will  lead  to  simplification  and  increased  Broker-Dealer 
compliance.  

Does caveat emptor still exist? 

Recently, upon researching securities laws that currently exist in South Korea, we noted that since June 1, 
2011, potential investors in Equity Linked Warrants have been required to take a one-hour training course 
available online and obtain a certificate of completion before being allowed to buy this product and are 
required to submit the certificate of completion, therefore, reducing the responsibility of the Registered 
Representative and the Broker-Dealer and at the same time. Increasing the responsibility of a client or 
investor through educating themselves and understanding the risks and rewards of the investment would 
give them more power and  responsibility for their own actions. For those of us old enough to remember 
Sy  Syms’  motto,  “An  educated  consumer  is  our  best  customer,”  we  should  adhere  to  his  principles. 
Modernization through required and evidenced investor education.  Our point here is that we are stunned 
that investors are effectively sometimes sold securities products that are theoretically accompanied by a 
put,  that  provides  them  with  a  potential  claim  against  the  broker-dealer  that  sold  them  a  securities 
product.  The rules that cover suitability have often been misused by customers who claim that the broker-
dealer woulda, shoulda, etc. prevented them from investing in a particular security.  In many instances, it 

Page 4 of 9 

 
 
 
  
is  the  customer  who  has  the  sophistication  to  understand  the  risks  embodied  in  a  particular  security.  
FINRA should consider modifying suitability rules such that clients, especially knowledgeable ones, bear 
more responsibility for their own actions. 

FINRA members are not homogenous 

FINRA should recognize that regulation and modernization should not come through a “one size fits all” 
philosophy. A twin-size sheet will not fit a Queen size bed. Diversity among FINRA members exists in the 
Broker-Dealer world. An Introducing Broker-Dealer is not a Clearing Firm and certainly not an Automated 
Transaction  System  or  a  Private  Placement  or  Investment  Banking  Firm.  Each  has  its  own  set  of 
requirements and parameters needed for compliance. It is ridiculous to have all of the same rules apply 
to each type of Broker-Dealer. The risks are so varied for both the Broker-Dealer with regard to the client 
or investor, which is dependent upon the type of investor, whether individual or Institutional or QIB or 
QIP. To expect that a small Broker-Dealer that is engaging in business with retail individuals should be 
required to abide by the same rules as an Investment Banking Firm engaging in business with well-known 
ultra wealthy institutions is unreasonable. Take for example the 3120- testing process and the related 
3130 Certifications. Wouldn’t FINRA already know, for example, if the Broker-Dealer has been compliant 
with most of the rules and regulations, especially in a year in which they were subject to a FINRA or SEC 
exam?  What  is  the  point  in  rehashing  what  the  compliance  officials  know  from  their  day-to-day 
surveillance?  What real difference does it make if a 3120 report is presented to Senior Management on 
the  46th  day  after  its  last  Board  Meeting  rather  than  the  45th  day?    Would  the  market  fall  apart? 
Rulemaking should take into account the type of business that a firm engages in and the type of clients 
they  service  and  decide  which  ones  really  make  a  difference  when  it  comes  to  investor  protection. 
Modernization of applicable rules based upon the lines of business of a Broker-Dealer (the “less is more 
approach”) would promote increased adherence to the rules.  

Speaking of voluminous regulation 

As an example of a regulatory initiative promulgated by the Securities and Exchange Commission, we call 
your  attention  to  SEC  Release  34-86031  (https://www.sec.gov/files/rules/final/2019/34-86031.pdf  )  , 
which represents a great cure for insomnia.  We don’t disagree with the concepts embodied in that release 
but offer it as a good example of what FINRA and other regulators should hesitate to do.  The PDF version 
of the release, which is entitled “Regulation Best Interest: The Broker-Dealer Standard of Conduct” is only 
a mere 770 pages long.  That means that if one were to read one page per day, it would take over two 
years to read and digest its contents.  Our point is that we hope that FINRA should adopt a specific goal 
of not being inspired by SEC initiatives that make lives so complicated. 

This  brings to  mind  the  enactment  of  Regulation  BI and  Form  CRS.   The concept  was  based on sound 
principles. Investors should know what alternatives are available and that investments are suitable for 
them and that the Broker-Dealer has their best interest at heart. For most registered individuals this is a 
given and it may have been an easier approach to require that Registered Persons take an Ethics Course 
(as is required by the NFA), rather than have to apply this burdensome requirement to a Firm for each 
breathing human being. Michael Bloomberg, Warren Buffett, and all other sophisticated investors who 
are known to be breathing air, would need to be given a Form CRS prior to or at the time that a “call to 
action” is provided. Can you please tell us about the logic in that?  Why don’t the Regulators require that 

Page 5 of 9 

 
 
 
  
a client or investor fill out a form which would attest to their understanding of what they are investing in 
(similar to the recommendation made above), so that the Registered Representative who actively engages 
in solicitation is not so discouraged from doing so by the onerous regimen of documentation, so much so, 
that their business suffers. Modernization includes practicality and ease in accomplishing the goal.  

We all acknowledge that Covid-19 changed the world, just as September 11, 2001, did, and that what was 
once simple and taken for granted was changed forever. Out of our experience in surviving these life-
altering changes came the change in the workplace and the recognition that nothing will be the same as 
it was before. Physical offices have largely been abandoned and many Associated Persons work remotely 
at least part of the time. This set up has for the most part been extremely successful. The definitions of 
the workplace changed and FINRA has recognized this and formalized this change through the revision of 
FINRA  Rule  3110  and  its  provisions  for  Remote  Office  Inspections.  We  applaud  this  step  in  the 
modernization  process  and  we  understand  that  it  needs  additional  steps  to  ensure  that  individuals 
working and supervising from their homes must comply with the same regulations as if they were working 
in a physical office.  

This leads into the next very relevant and incredibly important topics of Cybersecurity and REG S-P. With 
the changes from physical offices to remote workplaces, it is understandable that considerable time and 
effort must continuously be given to ensure that the remote locations work efficiently and in compliance 
with the law regarding Cybersecurity related issues. We support the modernization efforts that have been 
made which address  the  ever  changing and challenging Cybersecurity risks. These risks  are in need of 
constantly being analyzed and appropriately addressed. We support the Regulators’ efforts in addressing 
the new work order and the changing and modernizing of technology to capture threats to protect both 
Member Firms and investors. We recognize that technological solutions trump antiquated ones and as we 
are in the first quarter of the 21st century, we must forge ahead with the changes. Those of us that are old 
enough to remember cold rooms filled with computers and the “tube system” for conveying trades to the 
trading desk are fully cognizant that the securities industry must accept and embrace the changes. 

The  technological  responsibilities  need  to  be  shared.  We  are  appreciative  of  the  amendments  to 
Regulation  S-P  that  are  in  the  process  of  being  effected  which  would  allow  third-party  vendors  to 
participate  in  notification  of  investors  when  a  potential  breach  of  confidentiality  has  occurred.  This 
allowance of permitted shared responsibility, with oversight by the Broker-Dealer is a healthy approach 
to this topic and perhaps can be utilized more often in other aspects in the compliance-related world.  

Modernized  technology  also  encompasses  the  creation  and  proliferation  of  Artificial  Intelligence  (AI)  , 
which is  a new challenge for the Regulators, Member Firms and for investors. We can unequivocally state 
that this comment letter was not written by AI.  That being said, much of what is available through the 
internet  and  Social  Media  that  is  created  through  AI  can  be  misleading  and  deceptive  and  without 
recourse  can  potentially  create  havoc  in  the  marketplace.  We  believe  that  the  Regulators  can  be  a 
tremendous help in advising the general public about not “believing everything that you see”, which t is 
available  online.  Regulators  along  with  Broker-Dealers  can    help  avert  disastrous  investor  outcomes 
through their joint effort and cooperation in educating the public about the risks of Artificial Intelligence. 
Again, modernization includes education

FINRA’s role in the regulatory environment 

In this letter, we gave recognition to the fact that FINRA is but one cog in the global regulatory scheme.  If 
one  were  to  look  at  Form  BD,  it  becomes  clear  that  aside  from  FINRA,  there  are  multiple  registered 
exchanges  and  53  geographically  diverse  states  and  territories.    In  addition,  the  Municipal  Securities 
Rulemaking Board regulates the municipal securities industry, and the SEC is also a regulator.  What we 
really need is a D.O.R.E., a department of regulatory efficiency, reducing the requirements to the simplest 
common denominator 

We can only hope that FINRA takes our cues to make our industry more efficient by promoting a reduction 
in multiple regulations applicable to FINRA members.  What we explained above regarding RSLs is a great 
example of why states and territories should not have separate regulations from SEC and FINRA rules that 
are designed to regulate the very same activities.  Similarly, we are led to believe that even though the 
SEC has declared that certain firms that limit their activities to certain M & A efforts are exempt from SEC 
registration requirements, there are states that continue to require registration.  These kinds of conflicts 
are unfair and confusing.  We note that the SEC has an Office of the Advocate for Small Business Capital 
Formation.  SEC also should be promoting regulatory simplification and modernization to meet its goals 
in this regard. 

We are reminded of the National Securities Markets Improvement Act of 1996, which did wonders for 
certain financial services firms by eliminating needless duplication.  Its preamble is quite instructive.  It 
says: 

 “To  amend  the  Federal  securities  laws  in  order  to  promote 
efficiency  and  capital  formation  in  the  financial  markets,  and  to 
amend  the  Investment  Company  Act  of  1940  to  promote  more 
efficient  management  of  mutual  funds,  protect  investors,  and 
provide more effective and less burdensome regulation”.   

What  we  need  now  is  for  FINRA  to  demonstrate  that  it  has  the  interests  of  the  markets,  the  and  its 
membership and the general public at heart by advocating for a sequel to NSMIA of 1996.  Let’s get rid of 
needless rules promulgated by states, territories, SEC and others.   

We are inspired by an individual who is quite familiar to many of the old-timers at FINRA, who 
believed that rules needed to be clear and appropriate.

On November 4, 2004, Robert R. Glauber, the Chairman and CEO of NASD, in a speech given in Boca 
Raton, stated the following:  

“Another way we can try to make self-compliance easier is to be  
mindful of the burdens that our increased regulation and  
enforcement activities inflict on the industry.  While we must  
meet our mandate as an effective regulator, we should seek to do  
our regulatory job without needless intrusion or burden.  We  
should seek to set clear and appropriate rules and then enforce  
them rigorously and consistently.  

And we should, as we have over the last several years, regularly  
review our existing rules with the intent of simplifying them  
and, where appropriate, eliminating those that are out-of-date. 

We are particularly concerned that some of the most senior regulators have proudly put us all on notice 
that lately they have been promulgating more rules than they have promulgated in the recent past.  And 
worse than the rules themselves, is how they are enforced, at times.” 

We  genuinely  appreciate  FINRA’s  request  for  comments  to  help  serve  its  members  and  the  investing 
public better. We are moving to a more complicated, technological “2001 Space Odyssey” environment. 
Rule amendments which address reality, such as the amendments to the “Electronic Records” 17a-4 rule, 
demonstrated that Regulators are aware that records are maintained electronically, that CD-Roms are a 
thing of the past and “the Cloud” is a tool of the present. We need more changes like these. There are 
many unnecessary burdens imposed on Broker-Dealers through complicated rules, which scaled down to 
a KISS level, would lead to more compliance on the part of FINRA members. More is not better and greater 
imposition of rules only leads to the anxiety and frustration of Compliance Officers or other Associated 
Persons. Their inability to keep up with the rules and eventually can lead to the dissolution of small Broker-
Dealer Firms when complying with the rules becomes too onerous. Our mantra is “Modernization through 
Simplification, Standardization and Education.”

Re: Comments on FINRA’s Rule  Modernization Initiative Notice 25-04 

Dear Ms. Mitchell: 

Finalis Securities LLC (“Finalis”) appreciates the opportunity to provide feedback on FINRA’s 
ongoing rule modernization initiatives, particularly with respect to (1) the definition of 
“branch office” and related supervisory rules, (2) the adoption of artificial intelligence (“AI”) 
and the benefits and challenges, (3) the need for rule modernization to reflect the expanded 
digital footprints of registered representatives, and the challenges of effective supervision.  
Finally, we wish to comment on rule modernization with respect to (4) the supervision of 
brokerage accounts for firms like Finalis that primarily conduct business in non-public private 
placements and M&A transactions. 

Finalis Securities LLC (“Finalis”) is a registered broker-dealer and a leading technology-
enabled platform purpose-designed to support independent investment bankers, placement 
agents, and M&A advisors operating within the U.S. private capital markets. Founded in 2020, 
Finalis delivers a comprehensive regulatory infrastructure that enables affiliated registered 
representatives to conduct securities transactions under a supervised and compliant 
framework, without the operational overhead of maintaining their own separate business 
entity. 

Finalis distinguishes itself through the integration of modern digital workflows, secure cloud-
based systems, and AI-driven compliance tools that enhance supervisory controls and 
streamline deal execution. By leveraging technology to centralize compliance functions and 
enable real-time electronic surveillance, Finalis provides scalable, risk-sensitive oversight 
across a distributed and predominantly virtual network of representatives. 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
With over 500 affiliated professionals representing more than 300 investment banking firms, 
Finalis supports a broad spectrum of private placement and M&A activity, with over $90 billion 
in active deal volume as of year-end 2024. The platform's core mission is to democratize access 
to capital formation and advisory services by lowering structural barriers and enhancing the 
integrity and efficiency of transaction execution through a digitally native operating model. 

Finalis remains committed to operating in full compliance with SEC and FINRA regulations, 
while advocating for thoughtful modernization of legacy frameworks to better reflect the 
realities of digital-first business models in the contemporary broker-dealer environment. 

I. Branch Office Definition and Supervisory Structure  

The Need for Modernization 

As a digital-first broker-dealer and supervisory platform, Finalis represents over 400 
registered representatives nationwide, most of whom operate in a virtual capacity, often from 
private home offices or shared workspaces. These professionals conduct business using 
secure, cloud-based tools without engaging in traditional, in-person client activity associated 
with historical brick-and-mortar branch offices. 

We write to respectfully advocate for a modernization of the branch office framework that 
recognizes the shift toward digital operations and remote business models. Specifically, we 
urge FINRA to clarify that locations used exclusively for digital interaction—locations where 
no client meetings are held, that do not bear firm signage, where no checks or securities 
certificates are accepted for deposit, or other similar activities—should not be deemed “branch 
offices” under Rule 3110(f)(2). We also recommend amending the supervisory inspection 
cadence in Rule 3110(c) to differentiate between traditional branch offices and non-public-
facing digital locations. 

The current definition of “branch office” imposes registration and inspection obligations even 
on locations that provide no public presence or retail exposure, which includes many of Finalis’ 
associated persons. This structure: 

- Imposes undue costs: Registering and inspecting hundreds of low-risk, digitally operated 
home offices is a substantial administrative and financial burden. 

- Yields limited regulatory value: These locations do not serve as hubs for in-person client 
interaction, do not hold out physical signage, and do not maintain books and records on 
premises. 

- Disincentivizes innovation: The current model hampers the scalability of modern compliance 
platforms and restricts firms that invest in centralized, tech-enabled supervision. 

 
 
 
 
 
Suggested Framework for Reform 

We respectfully propose that FINRA revise its branch office definition to explicitly exclude 
remote locations that meet the following criteria: 

1. No signage or public-facing advertising at the location; 

2. Outside Business Activities that are held out to the public that do not effect retail 
transactions (e.g., Investment Banks).  

3. Occasional in-person client meetings conducted at the premises, and by appointment only; 

4. All client interaction conducted through secure, digital communication tools; 

5. All business records maintained in centralized, cloud-based systems accessible to the 
member firm; 

6. The associated person is supervised via electronic surveillance and subject to periodic 
remote audits and attestations. 

Under such a definition, these remote locations would be treated akin to “non-branch offices” 
or “OSJ satellites” and would be subject to tailored supervision under the firm’s supervisory 
system (per Rule 3110(a) and (b)), but not mandatory physical inspections per 3110(c). 

Alignment with Risk-Based Supervision Principles 

Modern regulatory priorities stress the importance of risk-based supervision and 
technological oversight mechanisms. Finalis believes the exclusion of digital-only locations 
from the branch office definition would align better with those principles, allowing firms to 
focus regulatory resources on actual points of risk and customer exposure. 

Additionally, Finalis’ cloud-native infrastructure enables robust electronic communication 
review, centralized recordkeeping, and ongoing monitoring of representative activity—all of 
which are more effective and scalable than legacy office inspections. 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
II. Adoption of Artificial Intelligence (AI) to augment traditional supervision 

We view AI not as a replacement for human supervision but as a powerful augmentation tool 
that supports the efficient and accurate identification of potential risks, anomalies, or 
violations across communications and transactional activity. In this context, Finalis has 
implemented AI models to assist in surveillance of electronic communications and 
identification of red flags in workflows, with all such use overseen by appropriately qualified 
supervisory personnel, consistent with our obligations under FINRA Rule 3110. 

To that end, we believe it is critical that FINRA provide further guidance on the following 
issues: 

1. **Human Oversight and Supervisory Accountability:** Finalis supports the principle that AI 
tools used in compliance functions must operate under the oversight of designated, qualified 
principals of the firm. We recommend FINRA affirm that the use of AI in supervisory systems 
does not displace the firm’s duty to designate responsible individuals under its supervisory 
procedures, and that such tools be implemented with clear human-in-the-loop controls. 

2. **Books and Records Considerations:** We seek clarification on whether output or analysis 
generated by AI tools (e.g., flagged items in communications surveillance, automated risk 
assessments) constitutes a regulatory “record” under SEA Rule 17a-4, and whether firms must 
explicitly label such output as AI-generated. A consistent industry position on this issue would 
promote transparency and uniformity in regulatory exams and enforcement expectations. 

3. **Risk Management and Testing Standards:** Finalis encourages FINRA to adopt a 
principles-based framework for the governance of AI tools used in regulatory contexts, 
emphasizing explainability, auditability, and proportional risk controls, rather than 
prescriptive technical standards that may not be feasible across diverse firm sizes and 
business models. 

Finalis remains committed to deploying AI in a responsible and compliant manner that 
enhances investor protection and strengthens supervisory effectiveness. We welcome 
continued dialogue with FINRA as it develops further guidance or rulemaking on this critical 
issue. 

 
 
 
 
 
  
  
  
  
  
III. Challenges of Supervising Expanding Digital Footprints and Need for Rule Clarity 

As a modern, tech-enabled broker-dealer, Finalis operates a digital-first platform designed to 
support independent investment bankers through a secure, cloud-native environment. We are 
deeply familiar with the complexity and breadth of digital communications today, including 
emails, messaging platforms, web presence, social media, and other public-facing or client-
interactive channels. 

In recent years, the digital footprint of registered representatives has expanded dramatically. 
This expansion, while reflective of broader industry innovation and investor preferences, 
introduces considerable challenges in maintaining robust supervision in accordance with 
existing regulatory requirements. The current rules framework—largely built around static 
definitions of written communications and physical supervision—does not fully accommodate 
the dynamic, fast-evolving nature of digital interactions. 

Accordingly, we respectfully request that FINRA consider rule modernization in the following 
areas: 

1. **Clarification of Supervisory Expectations Across Digital Channels:** FINRA should issue 
updated guidance that clarifies the scope of a member firm’s responsibility for capturing, 
reviewing, and supervising content across a broader array of communication platforms, 
particularly when third-party systems are used for client interaction or when third-party 
systems are used strictly for internal communications. This guidance should be risk-based and 
aligned with the actual conduct of business. 

2. **Recognition of Scalable, Technology-Driven Supervision Models:** We encourage FINRA to 
formally recognize the role of technology, including AI and automated workflows, in assisting 
firms to fulfill their supervisory responsibilities across digital communications. This includes 
tools for lexicon flagging, pattern recognition, and risk scoring to prioritize supervisory review. 
We believe it is critical for FINRA to require that  such tools must be deployed under oversight 
of qualified personnel, consistent with Rule 3110. 

3. **Flexible Recordkeeping Practices:** As communication methods proliferate, firms should 
have flexibility to adopt recordkeeping systems that are adaptive and technology-forward. This 

 
 
 
 
 
  
  
  
  
  
includes permitting use of cloud-based archives and integrations with API-driven capture 
systems, provided they meet the substantive requirements of SEA Rule 17a-4. 

4. **Digital Footprint Risk Assessments:** We urge FINRA to encourage or require firms to 
conduct periodic risk assessments of their representatives’ digital communications landscape, 
to proactively address channels that may fall outside legacy supervision programs. 

IV. Supervision of Outside Brokerage Account Activity 

Finalis is a registered broker-dealer that operates exclusively within the private capital 
markets, conducting transactions solely in private placements and non-public mergers and 
acquisitions. In this context, the current requirements under FINRA Rule 3210 and related 
supervisory obligations concerning the review of outside brokerage account activity impose 
significant administrative burdens, with limited practical compliance value in our particular 
business model. 

We respectfully propose that FINRA consider a rule modernization effort that introduces 
appropriate exemptions or a risk-based supervisory framework for firms like Finalis that do 
not engage in public market trading or activities involving material non-public information 
(MNPI) related to publicly traded issuers. Specifically, we believe that: 

1. Firms that transact exclusively in private securities and non-public M&A should not be 
required to collect and review outside brokerage account statements, absent a specific nexus 
to public market activity; 

2. Where public company transactions or MNPI are involved, Finalis fully supports the 
continued requirement to collect, review, and retain outside account activity records in 
accordance with current rules and expectations; and 

3. A risk-based approach, subject to supervisory documentation and internal control 
standards, would allow for tailored oversight based on the actual regulatory risk presented by 
a representative’s activities. 

4. A limitation of scope should apply only to individuals directly engaged in a transaction—
namely, the registered representative—excluding those who are merely associated with a 
member firm but not actively participating in deal activity. 

 
 
 
 
  
 
  
  
  
We believe this approach aligns with FINRA’s broader objectives to modernize its regulatory 
framework in a manner that reflects current industry practices, technological advances, and 
the diverse business models of member firms. Introducing flexibility into the application of 
Rule 3210 and related supervision obligations would alleviate unnecessary compliance costs 
for firms operating exclusively in the private capital markets, without compromising investor 
protection or market integrity. 

We welcome the opportunity to provide any additional information or operational context that 
may support FINRA’s modernization efforts

Dear Ms. Mitchell:  

Virtu Financial, Inc. (“Virtu”)1 is pleased to submit this letter in response to the above-
referenced  Requests  for  Comment.2    We  applaud  FINRA  for  engaging  proactively  with  its 
members,  investors,  and  other  market  participants  to  explore  innovative  approaches  to 
modernizing  its  rulebook.  In  an  evolving  financial  landscape  shaped  by  rapid  technological 
advancements, FINRA’s willingness to engage in data-driven analysis and to solicit feedback from 
its  members  and  the  public  are  necessary,  timely  and  commendable.  We  encourage  FINRA  to 
broaden  the  scope  of  this  initiative  to  encompass  additional  regulatory  topics  in  need  of 
modernization and to continue fostering meaningful public engagement through roundtables, open 
public  forums,  and  direct  outreach  to  member  firms  to  ensure  a  comprehensive  and  informed 
enhancement of the regulatory framework.   

Provided below are a few specific suggestions that we urge FINRA to examine as part of 

its review.

Rule 4560 – Short Interest Reporting 

We believe that FINRA should modernize Rule 4560 to provide greater clarity around the 
definition of “account”.  As currently written, the rule’s ambiguity may prevent firms from netting 
offsetting  long  and  short  positions  across  principal  accounts—even  when  such  positions  are 
economically neutral and belong to the same beneficial owner or aggregation unit. This can result 
in  overstated  short  interest  figures  that  do  not  reflect  the  firm’s  actual  exposure,  thereby 
undermining the quality and reliability of market-wide data. Aligning reporting requirements with 
firms’ economic positions, by permitting netting under appropriate conditions, would better serve 
the  rule’s  purpose  and  reduce  the  likelihood  of  unnecessary  market  volatility  caused  by 
misinterpreted figures. Furthermore, absent a clear definition of “account,” similarly situated firms 
with principal accounts may define accounts at degrees of granularity leading to inconsistent short 
interest reports. Without a clear definition, member firms are at the mercy of staff interpretations 
of “account” that may change over time and add to unpredictability.  

To support this improvement, FINRA should revise Rule 4560 to define “account” within 
the  rule.  Such  modernization  would  ease  compliance  burdens,  enhance  data  accuracy  and 
transparency,  and  increase  investor  confidence  in  the  information  disseminated.  Just  as  the 
pandemic accelerated the industry’s use of remote supervision and technology-based compliance, 
this  is  an  opportunity  to  reflect  evolving  practices  and  technology  in  a  ruleset  that  has  grown 
misaligned with the current environment. 

Rule 3110 – Supervision 

Office of Supervisory Jurisdiction 

The current definitions of Office of Supervisory Jurisdiction (OSJ) and branch office under 
Rule  3110  create  unnecessary  ambiguity  and  compliance  burdens  for  member  firms.  The 
regulatory  framework lacks clear delineation  between  these office  types,  particularly  regarding 
functional versus activity-based classifications.  This definitional overlap forces firms to navigate 
contradictory  guidance  when  determining  supervisory  structures,  resulting  in  inconsistent 
interpretations  across  the  industry.    The  current  rule’s  complexity  undermines  the  fundamental 
regulatory  objective  of  establishing  clear  supervisory  responsibilities,  as  firms  struggle  to 
definitively categorize offices that may simultaneously meet criteria for both designations.  This 
regulatory uncertainty exposes firms to examination deficiencies and enforcement actions despite 
good-faith compliance efforts, ultimately undermining market integrity rather than enhancing it. 

To enhance  regulatory clarity  and member compliance,  FINRA  should establish  bright-
line tests that clearly distinguish  OSJ from  branch  office  functions based  on supervisory  scope 
rather than specific business activities.  The rule should incorporate materiality thresholds, such as 
minimum revenue levels or transaction volumes, before triggering OSJ designation requirements.  
Additionally, FINRA should provide safe harbors for offices that maintain specific technological 
controls  or  alternative  supervisory  arrangements  that  achieve  equivalent  regulatory  outcomes.  

2

 
 
 
 
 
These reforms would reduce regulatory burden while maintaining investor protection by allowing 
firms  to  implement  risk-appropriate  supervisory  structures  tailored  to  their  specific  business 
models and technological capabilities. 

Currently,  FINRA  automatically  designates  an  office  as  an  OSJ  if  any  the  following 
business  activities  occur:  order  execution  or  market  making;  structuring  of  public  offerings  or 
private  placements;  maintaining  custody  of  customers’  funds  or  securities;  final  acceptance 
(approval) of new accounts on behalf of the member; review and endorsement of customer orders, 
and final approval of retail communications for use by persons associated with the member.  This 
provision  creates  a  disproportionate  regulatory  burden  without  a  corresponding  supervisory 
benefit. We recommend that FINRA move away from designating offices as OSJs based on the 
business  activities  conducted  at  the  office  and  instead  designate  an  office  as  an  OSJ  based  on 
whether supervisory activities are conducted from a particular office.  Members generally conduct 
their business activities and keep business records through electronic and automated systems that 
require minimal on-site personnel, making the traditional OSJ supervisory model both inefficient 
and unnecessarily costly.  This one-size-fits-all approach penalizes technological innovation and 
forces  firms  to  maintain  expensive  supervisory  infrastructure  where  risk-based  analysis  would 
support  alternative  oversight  mechanisms.  Instead,  FINRA  should  adopt  a  principles-based 
approach that allows firms to evaluate their actual supervisory needs based on their supervisory 
control systems and designated OSJs based on where and how supervision is conducted rather than 
categorical activity types. 

OTC Rules and Regulations 

There are several OTC-specific rules and regulations that have been adopted by FINRA 
over time, some of which have not been amended in a number of years. We believe that many of 
these  rules  would  benefit  from  review  as  part  of  this  project.  Given  the  overall  increase  in 
automation in the OTC markets, there are rules within FINRA Rule 6400, or other FINRA rules 
that impact OTC trading, that could be adjusted to account for changes in the OTC markets. 

An  example  of  this  would  be  FINRA  Rule  6438  related  to  quoting  the  same  price  in 
separate quotation mediums. Given changes in the OTC landscape, we believe that this rule should 
be adjusted or repealed in order to better align with the realities of the marketplace. Similar to the 
NMS markets, there are a number of reasons that a member firm may wish to display quotations 
at different prices across different inter-dealer quotation systems. As a whole, we believe that rules 
impacting the OTC markets should reflect the current realities of that marketplace. 

Residential Supervisory Locations / Branch Inspections 

We  also  commend  FINRA’s  adoption  of  Rule  3110.18,  which  established  a  voluntary, 
three-year Remote Inspections Pilot Program (the “Pilot Program”) that allows eligible member 
firms to fulfill their inspection obligations under FINRA Rule 3110(c)(1) through remote means, 
without conducting on-site visits. The Pilot Program commenced on July  1, 2024, and is set to 
conclude on June 30, 2027. 

3

 
 
 
 
 
 
We note that simply because a person is physically located at a residential location and 
performing supervisory activities from that location should not in and of itself cause that location 
be deemed a “RSL”, especially when the activities are occurring on centralized systems and no 
records are physically created and maintained at the residential location.  While for some firms it 
may be appropriate to designate a physical location as an OSJ or an RSL, we encourage FINRA 
to allow firms flexibility in how they supervise, how they conduct inspections, and to refocus the 
concept of supervision away from physical locations and on the manner of supervision.       

In  the  meantime,  we  strongly  urge  FINRA  to  allow  Rule  3110.18  to  remain  in  effect 
indefinitely  while  it  considers  the  topic  of  branches  holistically.  The  Remote  Inspections  Pilot 
Program reflects the modern realities of how financial services firms operate, particularly in a post-
pandemic  environment  where  hybrid  and  remote  work  arrangements  are  both  prevalent  and 
effective.  Remote  inspections  offer  a  flexible,  risk-based  approach  to  compliance  oversight, 
especially  for  low-risk  locations,  and  have  been  proven  operationally  effective  during  the 
temporary relief periods following COVID-19. The program enhances efficiency by reducing the 
logistical and financial burdens of on-site inspections without compromising investor protection, 
thanks  to  its  structured  risk  assessment  and  reporting  requirements.  Allowing  for  remote 
inspections supports innovation in compliance practices, promotes supervisory modernization, and 
provides firms with the flexibility needed to invest in scalable remote supervision infrastructure.  

Rule 3270 – Outside Business Activities and Rule 3280 – Private Securities Transactions 

FINRA’s current rules on Outside Business Activities (“OBA”) (Rule 3270) and Private 
Securities Transactions (“PST”) (Rule 3280) impose broad disclosure and approval requirements 
that sweep in many activities with no nexus to the securities industry. This overbreadth not only 
burdens  registered  representatives  with  compliance  obligations  unrelated  to  their  core 
responsibilities  but  also  diverts  firm  resources  toward  the  monitoring  of  low-risk  or  plainly 
personal endeavors. To modernize its rulebook and promote risk-based regulation, FINRA should 
revise these rules to focus solely on outside activities that are investment-related or that present a 
clear potential for conflicts of interest or investor harm. 

Narrowing the scope of OBA and PST requirements would better align FINRA’s oversight 
with its investor protection mandate, reduce regulatory overreach, and support a more practical 
and  proportional  approach  to  supervision.  In  an  era  when  many  professionals  engage  in  side 
ventures  for  income  diversification  or  personal  development,  requiring  disclosure  of  non-
investment-related activities – such as non-securities related freelance work, non-securities related 
real estate businesses, artistic endeavors, and many other businesses that do not involve the offer 
or sale of securities – does little to enhance market integrity or client protection. A more tailored 
rule set would preserve essential safeguards while fostering regulatory clarity and fairness for firms 
and their associated persons. 

4

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Due Process Enhancements 

FINRA should also incorporate stronger due process safeguards to ensure fair and equitable 
enforcement  proceedings.  A  critical  reform  needed  is  the  establishment  of  clear  temporal 
limitations that align FINRA’s enforcement authority with existing federal standards.  Currently, 
FINRA can pursue disciplinary actions for SEC rule violations even after the SEC’s own five-year 
statute of limitations has expired, creating an inequitable system where industry participants face 
prolonged exposure to enforcement actions that the primary federal regulator can no longer pursue.  
This  disparity  undermines  fundamental  fairness  and  creates  uncertainty  for  market  participants 
who reasonably expect that expired limitation periods provide finality. 

The  principle  of  regulatory  consistency  demands  that  FINRA’s  enforcement  timeline 
should not exceed that of the SEC when pursuing violations of federal securities laws.  If the SEC, 
as  the  primary  federal  securities  regulator,  determines  that  a  five-year  limitation  period  is 
appropriate  for  bringing  enforcement  actions,  FINRA  should  be  bound  by  the  same  temporal 
constraints when addressing identical rule violations.  Implementing such limitations would not 
only enhance due process protections but would also promote regulatory efficiency by encouraging 
timely  investigation  and  resolution  of  potential  violations.    This  reform  would  provide  much-
needed  certainty  to  the  industry  while  maintaining  FINRA’s  ability  to  effectively  fulfill  its 
regulatory mission within reasonable timeframes. 

Leveraging FINRA Systems to Support Member Compliance 

The Firm appreciates the work that FINRA has done to increase API access to data, such 
as  individual  registration  data.  However,  firms  such  as  ours  would  benefit  from  additional 
information being made available via API. The use of APIs allows us to automate certain functions 
and enhance our overall supervision.  

There are elements, such as regulatory requests, FINRA Report Cards, etc., that would be 
very  useful  to  receive  via  API  in  order  to  increase  automation  and  efficiency.  Additionally, 
adjustments  to  the  FINRA  Notification  API  would  be  a  significant  enhancement.  Currently, 
notifications are sent  even when there are  formatting changes made to the rule, which have no 
bearing on the rule itself. As a result, this generates a large number of updates, but very little useful 
content for the Firm to review. 

SRO Registration Harmonization 

Finally, we urge FINRA to play a leadership role in coordinating with national securities 
exchanges  to  unify  registration  requirements  across  all  self-regulatory  organizations  (SROs). 
Currently, firms and associated persons operating across multiple platforms face an inconsistent 
and  duplicative  registration  framework.  Different  exchanges  maintain  their  own  categories, 
qualification  exams,  and  continuing  education  obligations,  even  when  the  functional  roles  and 
responsibilities  of  registrants  are  substantially  similar.  This  regulatory  fragmentation  imposes 

5

 
 
 
 
unnecessary  administrative  and  financial  burdens  on  firms  without  providing  a  commensurate 
benefit to investor protection or market integrity. 

A  unified  registration  regime—developed  collaboratively  with  the  exchanges  and 
administered through a centralized framework—would reduce compliance complexity, promote 
workforce mobility, and improve regulatory efficiency. It would also reflect the reality of today’s 
integrated  and  technology-driven  markets,  where  personnel  often  serve  across  multiple  trading 
venues.  By  advocating  for  harmonization,  FINRA  can  help  modernize  the  SRO  registration 
landscape in a way that enhances transparency, reduces barriers to entry, and supports a more agile 
and competitive financial industry. 

* * * 

Virtu appreciates FINRA’s attention to this comment letter. The U.S. capital markets are 
the most vibrant, liquid, and transparent in the world, and it is essential to foster innovation to 
ensure they continue to thrive. Encouraging regulatory clarity and forward-thinking policies will 
not only help our markets grow but also ensure they remain competitive on a global scale while 
offering  investors  greater  choice  and  access  to  emerging  financial  technologies.  Virtu  looks 
forward to continued engagement with FINRA to support a regulatory framework that balances 
innovation with investor protection, ultimately strengthening the integrity and efficiency of our 
financial markets.

Re:  Regulatory  Notice  25-04:  FINRA  Launches  Broad  Review  to  Modernize  Rules  Regarding 
Member Firms and Associated Persons 

Dear Ms. Mitchell: 

The FIA Principal Traders Group (“FIA PTG”)1 appreciates the opportunity to comment on the 
FINRA  Review  to  Modernize  Rules  Regarding  Member  Firms  and  Associated  Persons  (the 
“Modernization Review”). FIA PTG members are among the most active providers of liquidity to 
derivatives markets in the US and welcome the opportunity to participate in the Modernization 
Review and commend FINRA for undertaking this worthwhile initiative. 

Please find our suggestions below: 

1.  CAT/ EBS 
FINRA should support industry efforts aimed at reducing the cost of the CAT, while maintaining 
information critical to surveilling for market integrity. Further, FINRA should undertake efforts to 
eliminate duplicative reporting in other systems such as TRF and EBS. 

a.  CAT:  FINRA  should  support  an  overhaul  of  the  current  system,  including  (a) 
dramatically reducing the annual budget and (b) transitioning the system into the SEC’s 
budget.  

1  FIA PTG is an association of firms, many of whom are broker-dealers, who trade their own capital on exchanges in 
futures,  options  and  equities  markets  worldwide.  FIA  PTG  members  engage  in  manual,  automated  and  hybrid 
methods of trading, and they are active in a wide variety of asset classes, including equities, fixed income, foreign 
exchange and commodities. FIA PTG member firms serve as a critical source of liquidity, allowing those who use 
the markets, including individual investors, to manage their risks and invest effectively. The presence of competitive 
professional traders contributing to price discovery and the provision of liquidity is a hallmark of well-functioning 
markets. FIA PTG advocates for open access to markets, transparency and data-driven policy.

b.  EBS: In connection with restructuring CAT, FINRA should support retiring EBS for 
all equities and options requests. When the CAT was adopted  – it was  premised on 
retiring EBS. Now we are left with duplicative costs. 

2.  TRF – Eliminate duplicative Reporting that is captured by CAT 
FINRA should review and remove all the requirements that are now made moot by CAT. TRF 
historically captured regulatory reporting data that was combined with OATS. All of this data is 
now captured by CAT and should be eliminated from the TRF. 

a.  all  requirements  for  sending  reports  that  are  non-Tape,  non-clearing  (e.g.,  ""riskless 

principal reports"", etc.). 

b.  all requirements on Tape and clearing reports that are not necessary for Tape volume 
or  clearing  functions  --  for  example,  to  report  either  party's  ""Capacity""  (Agent  or 
Principal) on a trade. 

3.  ADFs 
The IntelligentCross ADF proposal made clear that there is not an appropriate framework around 
ECNs and market makers quoting on the ADF, especially as it relates to markets that employ an 
intentional delay. FINRA should codify the approval process and ongoing requirements for ADF 
participants. 

a.  FINRA  should  set  out  a  clear  process  for  approval  and  ongoing  operation  of  ADF 
participants.  This  should  include  making  determinations  of  “automated  quotation” 
status and ongoing filing requirements for functionality changes. 

DRAFT

i.  FINRA  advanced  this  proposal  without  conducting  adequate  independent 

analysis. 

ii.  Automated quotation determination in any ECN or market maker that uses an 
intentional  delay  should  be  determined  only  through  a  rule  filing  clearly 
explaining the process that is filed with the Commission. 

4.  Scrutinizing ATS Private Rooms 
Private rooms in ATSs require greater transparency both in ATS filings and in trading volume. 
FINRA  has  taken  steps  to  ensure  reporting  of  volume  information  is  clearer  in  other  contexts, 
whereas an ATS that reports its volume conflates broadly available volume with one-to-one or 
one-to-some volume from private rooms. 

a.  In  connection  with  regulating  the  broker-dealer  operator  of  the  ATS,  require  more 

transparency on ATS-N regarding each liquidity pool available on the platform. 

b.  Publish  guidance  that  an  ATS  cannot  deem  all  orders  in  a  private  room  to  be  “Not 
Held”  (thereby  escaping  Rule  605  reporting  for  private  room  trading).  Give  ATS 
operators a reasonable timeline to comply.

5.  Improving the Margin Framework for Listed Options 
While capital requirements recognize the offset between options and their underlying equities, no 
cross-margining  exists  between  the  products  as  they  are  cleared  and  settled  at  different 
clearinghouses.  FIA  PTG  supports  building  the  capability  to  obtain  cross-margining  between 
equities and options in order to improve efficiency in the options market. We believe FINRA could 
help facilitate this by modifying Rule 4210. 

a.  FINRA should support efforts to achieve cross-margining between equities and options 

(NSCC and OCC). 

b.  In addition, Rule 4210 should be modernized and provide more flexibility to the OCC 
to implement a risk-based margin framework across all types of market participants. 
The importance of risk-based margin requirements should be increased compared to 
per contract minimums. 

6.  TRACE System 
FINRA should invest in TRACE and at a minimum bring it up to par with the functionality and 
tools available on the TRFs.  

a.  The specs for Treasuries, Corporates, and Munis are all different (not just due to the 

product types). 

b.  TRAQS  lacks  basic  functionality  compared  to  the  Nasdaq  TRF  or  NYSE  TRF  user 

terminals. There is no way to upload files for input or corrections; etc. 

DRAFT

7.  TRF and TRACE discrepancies 
TRF and TRACE perform similar functions for the stock and bond markets, respectively. However, 
there are several distinctions in the guidance associated with the two systems that appear to be 
system driven rather than rule driven. Stocks and bonds are both securities and should be subject 
to the same logic and guidance as it relates to transaction reporting. There should not be divergence 
between the two systems unless there is a clearly explained underlying rationale supported by law. 

a.  FINRA should compare and contrast the guidance associated with the two systems and 

align reporting. 

b.  FINRA uses the term “beneficial owner” and does not make clear when it means “title 
holder” or “ultimate beneficial owner.” FINRA should make clear what transactions 
require  public  reporting  and  what  transactions  require  reporting  without  public 
dissemination. 

c.  FINRA  should  as  a  matter  of  practice  consider  transactions  between  an  affiliated 
member  and  another  member  as  well  as  an  affiliated  member  and  a  non-member 
whereas existing FAQs often reference either one or the other leaving an obvious gap 
in guidance.

d.  FINRA should allow the parties to a bond trade to eliminate duplicative reporting to 
TRACE, by signing a Uniform Reporting Agreement (URA) – as is done with stock 
trades on the TRFs. Forcing both parties to report the same trade is costly and of little 
value. 

8.  TRF – Expand for Overnight Trading 
The TRFs should be open when the SIP is open in order to ensure appropriate transparency of the 
over-the-counter market during extended market hours. 

a.  Both the SIP and the TRFs need to be available during the hours that exchanges are 
open  for  trading  (e.g.,  23/5).  It  is  important  to  maintain  equivalent  levels  of 
transparency  for  both  on-exchange  and  off-exchange  trading  during  the  anticipated 
overnight sessions. While the TRFs are not currently open from 4am to 8am, we believe 
this should be addressed and extended when markets move to 23/5. 

9.  ORF/ TAF 
FINRA should work with the industry to rationalize regulatory fees in the options and equities 
markets. The options industry would benefit from streamlining market surveillance. In the equities 
markets, TAF should be allocated based the full range of products FINRA surveils. In the current 
state, complex products offered to customers that require a high level of oversight are subsidized 
by higher volume equities transactions. 

a.  ORF: In addition, FINRA should work with the options exchanges to streamline market 
surveillance in the options market and reduce duplicative requests and associated costs. 

DRAFT

b.  TAF: The FINRA TAF should be allocated based on cost and applied across the full 

range of asset classes subject to FINRA’s purview.  

10. Modernizing Rules re: Block Trading 

a.  Rule 5270 prohibits  a member from trading  in  a given security (or related financial 
instrument)  when  it  has  material,  non-public  market  information  concerning  an 
imminent block transaction in that security, a related financial instrument or a security 
underlying the related financial instrument prior to the time information concerning the 
block transaction has been made publicly available or has otherwise become stale or 
obsolete. 

FINRA  should  modernize  the  definitions  of  “publicly  available”  and  “stale  or 
obsolete.”   

11. Displaying OTC Equity Quotations in Multiple Quotation Mediums 

a.  Rule 6438 requires members that display priced quotations on a real-time basis for an OTC 
equity security in two or more quotation mediums to display the same priced quotations 
for the security in each medium, with an exception for certain quotations that represent a

Page 5 

customer  limit  order.  Given  the  inability  to  mark  an  order  as  “representative”  in  CAT, 
FINRA should update the rule to delete the reference to “represent.” 

12. Clarifying Registration Requirements 
As the market has become more automated, roles and responsibilities have changed. This has made 
it less clear which roles and responsibilities require registration. 

a.  Rule  1220  requires  certain  member  employees  to  register  as  a  “Securities 
Trader.”   FINRA  should  clarify  that  technology  support  functions,  such  as  turning 
on/off quoters, troubleshooting, and reconciliation, do not fall within this definition. 

13. Remote Inspection Requirements 
Remote  inspections  of  Registered  Representatives’  homes  or  remote  offices  should  only  be 
required in limited circumstances in which the RR interacts with public customers, or where they 
hold books and records, or customer cash, checks, or securities in their home. In many instances, 
RRs  are  simply  logging  into  firm  systems  that  capture  the  appropriate  books  and  records.  In 
addition, FINRA should make accommodations for circumstances that may prevent an RR from 
commuting to the office.  

a.  Should  only  apply  to  RRs  interacting  with  the  public.  Meeting  with  the  public, 

maintaining physical books and records, holding physical cash or securities. 

b.  RRs logging into Members’ systems to monitor activity or trade should not require an 

inspection. 

DRAFT

c.  There  should  be  a  clear  safe  harbor  for  ad  hoc  work  from  home  exceptions  (e.g., 

medical surgery, etc.). 

14. Annual CEO Certification Timing  
Annual CEO Certification timing should provide greater flexibility. 

a.  Rule 3130(b) requires a broker-dealer CEO to make a certification that “is effected no 
later than on the anniversary date of the previous year's certification.”  This results in 
the date moving up each year, as firms do not want to wait until the last day. The filing 
deadline should be the last day of the month that is 12 months after the previous year’s 
certification. 

15. Institutional Account Definition 
FINRA’s asset standard of $50 million to be considered an “institution” is inconsistent with other 
standards in the industry and has limited growth in some markets, including cash Treasuries.   

a.  Rule 4512(c) should be amended to align with the $10 million asset standard in the 

Commodity Exchange Act’s Eligible Contract Participant (ECP) definition.

Re: Regulatory Notice 25-04: FINRA Requests Comment on a Broad Review to Modernize Rules Regarding 

Member Firms and Associated Persons 

Dear Ms. Mitchell: 

On behalf of the Insured Retirement Institute (IRI)1As the leading trade association for the retirement income 
industry, we appreciate the opportunity to comment on FINRA Regulatory Notice 25-04 (Notice 25-04), 
representing a broad review of its regulatory requirements applicable to member firms and associated persons.2 

IRI’s members include the entire supply chain of insured retirement strategies—life insurers, asset managers, 
broker-dealers, banks, and marketing organizations—who collectively serve millions of Americans planning for a 
secure and dignified retirement. As such, we have a strong interest in ensuring that regulatory frameworks 
governing financial professionals remain effective, transparent, and appropriately tailored to diverse and 
evolving business models. 

IRI strongly supports FINRA's purpose, mission, and regulatory authority, and commends FINRA’s ongoing efforts 
to streamline and update regulations to reflect current business practices and technological advancements. 
FINRA's modernization initiative is critical to furthering its investor protection and market integrity mission by 
identifying opportunities to make its rules more efficient and effective. These updates should reflect the 
contemporary market environment, align with existing non-FINRA regulatory requirements, and support future 
evolution in financial services. We offer the following recommendations for consideration. 

Hypothetical Illustrations and Assumed Rates  

FINRA currently reviews Registered Index-Linked Annuity (RILA) illustrations under FINRA Rule 2210 
(Communications with the Public),3 prohibiting the use of assumed hypothetical rates for non-variable products. 
However, our members believe these illustrations should be evaluated under FINRA Rule 2211 (Communications 
with the Public About Variable Life Insurance and Variable Annuities)4. Rule 2211 permits the use of hypothetical 
illustrations to demonstrate how variable contract performance might affect cash values and death benefits, 

1 The Insured Retirement Institute (IRI) is the leading association for the entire supply chain of insured retirement 
strategies, including life insurers, asset managers, broker-dealers, banks, marketing organizations, law firms, and solution 
providers. IRI members account for 90 percent of annuity assets in the U.S., include the foremost distributors of protected 
lifetime income solutions, and are represented by financial professionals serving millions of Americans. IRI champions 
retirement security for all through leadership in advocacy, awareness, research, diversity, equity, and inclusion, and the 
advancement of digital solutions within a collaborative industry community.

provided such illustrations adhere to guidelines that prohibit projections or predictions of investment results. 
Specifically, Rule 2211(b)(5)(A)(i) allows these illustrations, provided they mirror the required disclosures in the 
prospectus.5 

FINRA has indicated that applying Rule 2211 to RILAs would necessitate an SEC rule change explicitly including 
RILAs. Nonetheless, distributors require these illustrations for effective product comparisons under Regulation 
Best Interest (Reg BI)6 and related regulatory obligations. 

Brokerage Payments to Doing Business As (DBA) Entities 

Allowing brokerage payments directly to DBA entities, which are often set up by independent financial 
professionals and insurance agents to operate their businesses, would simplify administrative processes, reduce 
confusion, and better reflect contemporary business structures. It would also align with the practices of advisory 
payments, which can be paid directly to DBA entities. This flexibility ensures smoother operational management 
and streamlines the process of paying compensation to financial professionals. 

Gift Rule Adjustments for Inflation  

The current FINRA gift limit of $100 has remained unchanged for many years.7 Regularly adjusting this threshold 
for inflation would maintain the rule's relevance, reduce compliance challenges, and prevent the inadvertent 
violation of limits due to economic changes. In addition, we agree with FINRA’s new proposal that clarifies that 
individual retail customers of a broker-dealer are not in the category of clients of institutional customers.8 

Fingerprinting Requirements for Overseas Personnel  

International operations are increasingly common, yet the existing fingerprinting requirements create logistical 
challenges. Many countries prohibit fingerprinting their citizens based on local laws and regulations (e.g., the 
European Union’s General Data Protection Regulation, or “GDPR”), even with consent. FINRA should work with 
the SEC to address Rule 17f-2 of the Securities Exchange Act of 19349 and permit firms to follow these local laws 
without fear of enforcement from the SEC. Designating approved overseas vendors or refining the definition of 
an ""associated person exempt from registration"" would further significantly ease these burdens and enhance 
compliance capabilities for global operations. 

Narrowing the Definition of ""Complaint"" 

FINRA's broad definition of ""complaint, “which uses the undefined term “grievance,” currently sweeps in for 
reporting purposes routine service inquiries or simple misunderstandings.10 Defining “grievance” to capture only 

5 FINRA Rule 2211(b)(5)(A)(i): Hypothetical illustrations using assumed rates of return may be used to demonstrate the way 
a variable life insurance policy operates. The illustrations show how the performance of the underlying investment accounts 
could affect the policy cash value and death benefit. These illustrations may not be used to project or predict investment 
results as such forecasts are strictly prohibited by the Rules. The methodology and format of hypothetical illustrations must 
be modeled after the required illustrations in the prospectus.

substantive complaints will allow firms to allocate resources more effectively and address genuine consumer 
concerns. 

Marketing Regulatory Review Requirements  

Firms frequently encounter uncertainty around the requirements for reviewing non-brokerage marketing 
materials. Greater clarity and specificity in these guidelines would streamline internal compliance processes, 
reduce inadvertent non-compliance, and enable firms to allocate compliance resources more effectively. 

Automating Non-Automated Customer Account Transfer Service (ACATS). Transfers  

Non-ACAT transfers are time-consuming, manually intensive, and prone to operational risk.11 Collaboration 
between FINRA and industry professionals and specialists to establish an automated, standardized process 
would substantially improve the accuracy, timeliness, and customer satisfaction of transfer activities. 

Documentation for Reasonably Available Alternatives (RAAs) and Form CRS (Customer Relationship Summary) 
Delivery  

There remains considerable ambiguity around documentation standards for RAAs and the Reg BI’s Form CRS 
delivery requirements.12 First, the SEC’s Adopting Release for Reg BI made clear that Firms “are not required to 
prepare and maintain documentation regarding the basis for each specific recommendation, including an 
evaluation of a recommended securities transaction or investment strategy against similar available 
alternatives.”13  We do not believe such documentation should be required for RAA.  Guidance regarding the 
Firm’s RAA process, which is part of a Firm’s policies and procedures, could be helpful.  Similarly, guidance 
regarding documentation for the delivery of the Form CRS could alleviate firms' administrative burdens. 

Statement Delivery Modernization  

The modernization of statement delivery should address outdated trade confirmation requirements, reconsider 
the frequency of statements, allow the consolidation of statements for household accounts, and expand 
electronic delivery options. Furthermore, amending Rule 2231 to permit statement delivery to authorized 
Powers of Attorney (POA) for vulnerable or senior investors would strengthen investor protections and improve 
customer experience.14 

Registrations and Principal Registrations 

The Series 24 principal registration requirements may no longer fully align with current senior executive roles.15 
Reviewing and possibly revising these requirements or introducing a new executive-level examination would 
better reflect senior management responsibilities and align regulatory oversight with modern organizational 
structures, whereby an executive may be promoted into a role suddenly requiring registration after having 
previously not held or let lapse licenses. This creates the requirement that an individual with vast experience is 

11 FINRA Rule 11870 governs customer account transfers, including those not handled through the Automated Customer 
Account Transfer Service (ACATS). If ACATS isn't used, the transfer process is handled manually, following similar 
procedures but potentially taking longer. The rule applies to both whole account transfers and transfers of specifically 
designated assets.

required to become licensed because they are in senior management, with certain individuals having to take 
three or more exams over a short period of time, simply because they were promoted into a new role. 

IRI appreciates FINRA’s consideration of these recommendations. We believe these rule modifications and 
modernizations will foster regulatory clarity, reduce compliance burdens, and enable firms to serve their clients 
more effectively.

Re:  Rule Modernization: Regulatory Notice 25-04 

Dear Ms. Mitchell, 

Fidelity Investments (“Fidelity”)1 appreciates the opportunity to provide comments to the 

Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (“FINRA”) on its broad review of its regulatory 
requirements as described in Regulatory Notice 25-04 (“RN 25-04”).2  

We fully support FINRA’s efforts to modernize its rules to further its mission of investor 

protection and market integrity by supporting more efficient and effective regulatory 
requirements.  We agree that changes should be made to help FINRA adapt its oversight to 
changing business practices and markets; support innovation and the deployment of new 
technologies and services that benefit markets and investors; and build better tools and resources 
to help member firms serve investors.  In the context of its modernization review, we also refer 
FINRA to Fidelity’s comment letters on prior FINRA proposals, listed in Appendix A.  

Executive Summary 

As FINRA undertakes a broad review of its rules, we recommend that FINRA focus on 

the following areas: 

1 Fidelity is one of the world’s leading providers of financial services, including investment management, 
retirement planning, portfolio guidance, brokerage, benefits outsourcing, and other financial products and services. 
We administer approximately $12.6 trillion in assets from nearly 50 million individual investors, 24,000 employer 
client firms, 16,000 wealth management firms and institutions, and 8.5 million clearing and custody accounts. 

2 See Financial Industry Regulatory Authority; Rule Modernization, RN 25-04 (March 12, 2025), available at 
https://www.finra.org/sites/default/files/2025-03/Regulatory-Notice-25-04.pdf.  In addition to RN 25-04, FINRA 
also published RN 25-07 regarding the organization and operation of member workplaces.  See Financial Industry 
Regulatory Authority; Supporting Modern Member Workplaces, RN 25-07 (April 14, 2025), available at 
https://www.finra.org/sites/default/files/2025-04/Regulation-Notice-25-07.pdf.  Fidelity intends to submit a separate 
comment letter in response to RN 25-07, addressing numerous issues, including remote inspections, residential 
supervisory location qualifications, licensing, branch office designations under FINRA Rule 3110, and 
communications.

1.  Default to digital delivery for all regulatory communications.  
2.  Partner with the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) to review Pay-to-Play 

Rules. 

3.  Amend the FINRA Code of Arbitration (“Code”) to allow clearing broker-

dealers/qualified custodians to file pre-hearing motions to dismiss. 

4.  Reconsider the impractical 30-day notice requirement for broker-dealers created by 
FINRA RN 21-27, particularly where the removal of a particular sweep product is 
beyond the broker-dealer’s control. 

5.  Comprehensively review broker-dealer trade reporting requirements. 
6.  Expand the definition of “institutional account” to include sophisticated investors, 

rather than relying on a $50M asset threshold. 

7.  Revise FINRA guidance so as to require firms to direct customers to BrokerCheck for 

departing representatives’ new contact information. 

8.  Eliminate the additional representation obligations on “restricted persons” acting as a 

Finder or in a Fiduciary capacity under FINRA Rule 5130. 

1. 

Digital Delivery Should Be the Default for Regulatory Communications  

We strongly urge FINRA to work closely with the SEC and the Municipal Securities 
Rulemaking Board (“MSRB”) to modernize their delivery rules to make digital delivery the 
default method for delivery of all regulatory communications.  Electronic delivery is more 
efficient and more reliable.3  In 2025, as the financial services industry begins to welcome digital 
assets, it is time to transition away from a centuries-old approach (paper) that is both more costly 
and less effective. 

We also encourage FINRA to review its rules to eliminate any “in writing” requirements, 

which include, but are not limited to, rules regarding confirmations and account statements 
(FINRA Rules 2230, 2231, and 2232), as well as several corresponding SEC rules and 
regulations.  Revising the text from “in writing” to “furnishing” or “providing” would eliminate 
any confusion that the SEC’s rules and interpretations apply to the delivery of regulatory

documents instead of being regulated under the E-Sign Act.4  Currently, this discrepancy creates 
confusion for investors, as many have attempted to consent either over the phone or through a 
paper account application for electronic delivery.  Finally, the E-Sign Act arguably requires an 
additional step to confirm e-delivery consent electronically, but FINRA should clarify that this 
extra step is not required by current SEC electronic delivery guidance.  

2. 

The Pay-to-Play Rules Exceed Statutory Authority and Raise Significant 
Constitutional Issues  

SEC Rule 206(4)-5 and FINRA Rules 2030 (Engaging in Distribution and Solicitation 

Activities with Government Entities) and 4580 (Books and Records Requirements for 
Government Distribution and Solicitation Activities) (collectively, the “Pay-to-Play Rules”) 
exceed the SEC’s statutory authority.  As with the SEC, FINRA’s authority to promulgate rules 
under applicable law is limited to preventing fraudulent, deceptive, or manipulative acts or 
practices, and identifying means reasonably designed to prevent such acts or practices.5  Neither 
the SEC nor FINRA has the authority to create what are in effect strict-liability limits on political 
contributions.  In addition, the SEC and FINRA have two-year look-back provisions that also 
exceed their authority.  The SEC’s and FINRA’s Pay-to-Play Rules go well beyond what would 
be reasonably designed to prevent manipulative acts or practices. 

The Pay-to-Play Rules also raise significant First Amendment concerns, a problem 
compounded by the vagueness of the Rules.6  Notably, in promulgating SEC Rule 206(4)-5, the 
SEC did not identify a relevant problem in the industry stemming from political contributions.  
Rather, the cases cited by the SEC involved, for the most part, cash kick-back schemes related to 
placement agent consultants that were already illegal, separate and apart from any Pay-to-Play 
Rules.  Nor did the SEC justify the two-year look-back period for political contributions made up 
to two years before a person even becomes a covered associate.  The SEC admitted that the rule 
was “prophylactic,” but the United States Supreme Court explicitly rejected that approach in 
FEC v. Cruz, 596 U.S. 289, 306 (2022).  Moreover, the Rules’ vagueness makes it very difficult, 
if not impossible, to clearly determine who qualifies as a covered associate (especially when it 
comes to executive officers) or covered state or local candidates or officials. 

We encourage FINRA to work with the SEC to address the Pay-to-Play Rules. 

4 The Electronic Signatures in Global and National Commerce Act (“E-Sign Act”) states that “if a statute, 
regulation, or other rule of law requires that information relating to a transaction or transactions in or affecting 
interstate or foreign commerce be provided or made available to a consumer in writing,” then specific requirements, 
which are different from the SEC’s, must be met to deliver it digitally. See 15 USC S.7001, available at 
https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/15/chapter-96.

The FINRA Code of Arbitration Procedure Discourages Pre-Hearing Motions to 
Dismiss, Unfairly Requiring Clearing Broker-Dealers/Custodians to Defend Against 
Frivolous Claims   

There has been a proliferation of frivolous litigation filed in FINRA arbitration against 

broker-dealers (including clearing firms/qualified custodians) by claimants who seek to hold the 
firms vicariously liable for the alleged acts or omissions of introducing broker-dealers/registered 
investment advisor (“RIAs”), simply by virtue of carrying those firms’ end customer accounts.  
A fully disclosed clearing firm/custodian is forced to expend significant time and resources 
defending itself all the way through discovery and hearings that are based on activities that have 
been exclusively allocated to the introducing firm (or RIA) by contract, or where the claims are 
devoid of any facts suggesting participation on the part of the clearing firm/custodian.  The costs 
and distraction of such litigation, as well as the inevitable costs of settling nuisance claims, have 
a profoundly negative impact on the industry and customers. 

More than seven years ago, in March 2018, FINRA sought industry comment on a 

retrospective review of FINRA Rule 4311 (Carrying Agreements)7, one of the most important 
FINRA rules governing the clearing industry.  Fidelity proposed, among other things, amending 
the Code to allow a clearing firm to file a pre-hearing motion to dismiss based on the judicially 
recognized limited back-office role of the clearing firm.8  This proposal would align the Code 
with the allocation of responsibilities required by FINRA Rule 4311 and is supported by judicial 
precedent.9  To date, FINRA has not published its findings on the FINRA 4311 rule 
retrospective.

FINRA RN 21-27: SEC Interpretation of SEA Rule 15c3-3 Creates an Impractical 30-
day Notice Standard for a Broker-Dealer Where a Sweep Product Needs to Be 
Removed  

Securities Exchange Act (“SEA”) Rule 15c3-3(j)(2)(ii)(B)(3)(i)(C) governs “changing, 

adding or deleting products through a Sweep Program.”  In FINRA RN 21-27, FINRA 
announced that the SEC staff had communicated to FINRA that broker-dealers must provide 30-
days notice to the customer when changing a sweep product, including where the broker-dealer 
added or removed any bank or money market mutual fund from a sweep program.  It is, 
however, impractical, if not impossible, to provide 30-days notice for a change in banks or 
money market mutual funds where removal is required due to events beyond the broker-dealer’s 
control—such as a bank failure or a bank’s or money market mutual fund’s termination of its 
participation in a sweep program.  We have previously provided proposed language to FINRA to 

7 FINRA RN 18-10. 
8 In 2009, FINRA amended its arbitration rules to “discourage” pre-hearing motions to dismiss and expressly 
limited pre-hearing motions to dismiss to one of three scenarios: (1) prior settlements and releases; (2) movant is not 
associated with the account, security or conduct at issue; or (3) res judicata/collateral estoppel.  See FINRA Rule 
12504.

address various situations outside of a broker-dealer’s control—and suggested that the notice 
provision be satisfied by providing notice to the customer on the customer’s next available 
account statement—but to date we are unaware of any action taken in response to the proposal.  

Reconsidering this interpretation would be consistent with past practice, such as when the 

Reserve Primary Funds (the “Funds”) “broke the buck” in September 2008.  There, member 
firms asked FINRA whether they may make bulk exchanges of customer assets that were 
invested in the Funds without complying with the requirements of NASD Rule 2510(d)(2) then 
in effect, including the 30-day notice period.  Given the need to protect investors, and after 
consultation with the SEC staff, FINRA agreed to permit bulk exchanges of customer assets 
without compliance with all of the provisions of Rule 2510(d)(2), subject to certain conditions—
such as written notification to customers being sent “promptly thereafter.”10  Similar 
considerations should apply here. 

5. 

Broker-Dealer Trade Reporting Requirements Warrant a Comprehensive Review 

Broker-dealer trade reporting requirements play a critical role in helping regulators 

ensure market transparency, regulatory compliance, and investor protection.  However, current 
reporting requirements are governed by a complex web of systems involving multiple regulatory 
bodies, such as the SEC, FINRA, MSRB, and the national securities exchanges.  Regulators have 
developed distinct rulesets for these systems independently and incrementally over time.  We 
urge FINRA to lead a comprehensive review of broker-dealer trade reporting requirements to 
determine areas in which regulatory guidance is needed, identify requirements to be consolidated 
and/or eliminated, evaluate its ability to share information among market participants, and 
consider whether fees charged to purchase data meet requisite requirements.  

Trade reporting is a complicated area with obligations that are often difficult to 

implement in practice. 11  Lack of published regulatory guidance has increased the risk of 
inconsistencies or errors in reporting and allowed regulators to ensnare broker-dealers for mere 
foot-faults, even where there is no customer harm.  In the context of a review of broker-dealer 
trade reporting requirements, FINRA should solicit requests for trade reporting guidance as part 
of a broad effort to transform and modernize reporting requirements.   

While broker-dealers comply with a myriad of detailed reporting requirements across 
multiple systems, many of the requirements are duplicative and should be consolidated and/or 
eliminated.  For example, broker-dealers must comply with Electronic Blue Sheet (“EBS”) 
requests, which require detailed post-trade data submissions to the SEC and other regulators, 

10 FINRA RN 08-48, September 18, 2008. 
11 For example, among others, broker-dealers must report trade data to: FINRA’s Trade Reporting Facilities 

(“TRFs”), Alternative Display Facility (“ADF”), OTC Reporting Facility (ORF), the Consolidated Audit Trail 
(“CAT”), Large Options Position Reporting (“LOPR”) system; MSRB’s Real-Time Transaction Reporting System 
(“RTRS”); FINRA’s Trade Reporting and Compliance Engine (TRACE); and make reports pursuant to SEC Rules 
605 and 606.  In the future, broker-dealers will also be subject to FINRA’s Securities Lending and Transparency 
Engine (SLATE™) Covered Securities Loan transaction reporting requirements. 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Office of the Secretary, FINRA

Page 6 of 8 

often within tight deadlines.  Meanwhile, firms are simultaneously subject to real-time trade 
reporting obligations as contributors to the Consolidated Audit Trail (“CAT”), a comprehensive 
database that collects order and trade life cycle events across the equities and options markets.  
The coexistence of EBS and CAT highlights the redundant nature of trade reporting regimes, as 
both systems capture overlapping data through different mechanisms and formats.  We urge 
FINRA to explore the components of these systems that can be consolidated and/or deleted in the 
context of a trade reporting review.12 

In addition, while broker-dealers provide tremendous volumes of order and trade data to 
FINRA to support its surveillance and oversight activity, FINRA does not share, in real-time or 
near real-time, trade reporting data with broker-dealers that could help to prevent market 
manipulation and better protect investors.  Broker-dealers do not have access to the street-wide 
view of activity available to FINRA. Without such access, broker-dealers are unable to act 
quickly to stop potential fraud or manipulative activity occurring across market participants.  
FINRA should consider how it can implement data sharing or facilitate communication among 
market participants that would help to combat threats to the market and harm to investors. 

Moreover, regulators often needlessly charge broker-dealers twice for regulatory 
reporting.  Broker-dealers are required to report certain transaction data, and they incur 
regulatory fees in connection with that reporting.  Then, after the same data is consolidated, 
broker-dealers must purchase it back from regulators at a marked-up rate.  For example, FINRA 
has announced fees for broker-dealers (1) to report SLATE data to FINRA and (2) to purchase 
consolidated SLATE data from FINRA.13  It is fundamentally unfair to force firms to re-acquire 
transaction data at inflated prices.  While we appreciate the need to recover the costs for building 
and operating reporting systems, such fees must meet the requirements for fees under the 
Exchange Act, namely that they are (i) reasonable, (ii) equitably allocated, (iii) not unfairly 
discriminatory, and (iv) not an undue burden on competition.14 

12 There are also redundancies between TRF, CAT Customer and Account Information System (“CAIS”), and 
EBS reporting that result from when new regulations are introduced that incorporate aspects of older requirements.  
Although these requirements may not be the same, it would be helpful to have clarity regarding the intent for each 
requirement and how it differs across each application.  We note that SEC Chairman Paul Atkins recently 
announced that he has asked SEC staff to undertake a comprehensive review of the CAT, including but not limited 
to costs, reporting requirements, and the scope of what is collected.  We encourage FINRA to work with SEC staff 
on this effort.  See Paul Atkins, Chairman, Securities and Exchange Commission, prepared remarks before SEC 
Speaks 2025 (May 19, 2025) available at: https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/atkins-prepared-
remarks-sec-speaks-051925.  

13 FINRA, consistent with the SEC’s Rule 10c-1a, proposed a rule change with immediate effectiveness to 
establish securities loan reporting fees and securities loan data products with associated fees in connection with 
FINRA’s SLATE rule series.  See Notice of Filing and Immediate Effectiveness of a Proposed Rule Change to 
Adopt Fees in FINRA Rule 7720 (Securities Lending and Transparency Engine (SLATE™)), Release No. 34-
101697, File No. SR-FINRA-2024-020 (Nov. 21, 2024), 89 FR 93750 (Nov. 27, 2024).

A FINRA-led review of broker-dealer trade reporting requirements is both timely and 

warranted.  This review would seek to enhance regulatory guidance, improve accuracy of 
reporting, reduce redundancies, and improve the quality of regulatory oversight.  This review 
would also help ensure that broker-dealer costs to produce and submit data to regulators is 
commensurate with its benefits and align fees for trade and transaction data with requirements 
under the Exchange Act.  

6. 

FINRA Rule 4512(c)’s Definition of “Institutional Account” Should be Updated and 
Expanded to Include Sophisticated Investors Rather than Relying on the $50M Asset 
Threshold 

FINRA Rule 4512(c) defines “institutional account” as the account of a bank, savings and 

loan association, insurance company, registered investment company, registered investment 
adviser or any other person (whether a natural person, corporation, partnership, trust or 
otherwise) with total assets of at least $50 million.  A member must treat any account that does 
not meet this strict definition as a “retail account.”  FINRA’s current definition of “institutional 
account” is antiquated, too rigid, and does not reflect the evolution of the marketplace over the 
last 14 years.  For example, the current definition prevents certain entity types, such as 
unregistered hedge funds, money managers, and family offices that do not have at least $50 
million in total assets from participating in product and asset offerings available only to 
“institutional accounts.”  FINRA’s definition of “institutional account” should be expanded to 
include such entities regardless of their assets under management because these entities are 
sophisticated investors that do not need the protections afforded to retail accounts.  In the 
alternative, FINRA should broaden the scope of the definition by lowering the asset threshold for 
“institutional accounts.”   

7. 

FINRA Should Require Firms to Direct Customers to BrokerCheck for Departing 
Representatives’ New Contact Information 

In FINRA RN 19-10, FINRA stated that a member firm must provide contact information 

for the departing representative (with his/her consent) to clients when the representative leaves 
for another firm.  There is an easier, more efficient way to provide more information: customers 
should be directed to BrokerCheck, which exists for this very reason.  Information regarding a 
representative’s new firm can easily be found through FINRA’s BrokerCheck system.  Directing 
customers to BrokerCheck for a representative’s new contact information would have the added 
benefit of ensuring that the customer is aware of any relevant disclosures related to the departed 
representative.  Therefore, FINRA should direct customers to FINRA’s BrokerCheck website if 
they want to obtain information on a former associate’s new firm, rather than requiring the 
previous employer to insert itself in the referral business. 

8. 

Eliminate Additional Representation Obligations on “Restricted Persons” Acting as a 
Finder or in a Fiduciary Capacity under FINRA Rule 5130  

We support FINRA’s efforts to facilitate capital formation and recommend a change to 

FINRA Rule 5130 to create a more efficient capital formation process.  

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Office of the Secretary, FINRA 
June 11, 2025 
Page 8 of 8 

FINRA Rule 5130 prohibits a broker-dealer from selling an initial public offering of an 

equity security to an account in which a “restricted person” has a beneficial interest.  Under 
5130(i)(10), “restricted person” is defined as (A) Broker-Dealers; (B) Broker-Dealer Personnel; 
(C) Finders and Fiduciaries; (D) Portfolio Managers; and (E) Persons Owning a Broker-Dealer.   

The definition of a “restricted person” as “Finders and Fiduciaries” is predicated on 

whether the person is a Finder or Fiduciary “with respect to the security being offered.”15  In 
practice, this requirement means that the broker-dealer must ask their customer, on each and 
every new issue offered, as to whether the customer was a Finder or Fiduciary with respect to the 
security being offered, rather than allow the broker-dealer to obtain a blanket statement from the 
customer that the customer is not a Finder or Fiduciary.  This repetitive process is frustrating to 
customers and introduces friction into the new issue process.  

FINRA should eliminate the “with respect to the security being offered” language in 

FINRA Rule 5130(i)(10)(C) to create a more efficient capital formation process.

Re:  Regulatory Notice 25-04: Rule Modernization 

Dear Ms. Piorko Mitchell, 

SIFMA1 submits comments in response to Regulatory Notice (RN) 25-04.2 We appreciate 

FINRA’s commitment to continuous improvement and welcome this effort to modernize and 
update its regulatory requirements applicable to broker-dealers and associated persons, as well as 
working with other regulators whose requirements are applicable to them, including the SEC, to 
fully realize its goal. 

SIFMA provides a non-exhaustive list of topics and rules below that is responsive to 

FINRA’s request and a brief explanation for the action requested. This list includes FINRA rules 
and requirements as well as certain non-FINRA requirements appliable to broker-dealers that we 
believe should be amended and/or repealed. SIFMA believes that addressing these topics could 
result in reduced burdens, costs, and confusion, and greater opportunities for investors. We have 
prioritized the topics into two categories to denote the importance or urgency of these issues for 
our members: 1) high priority and 2) other priorities.  

1 SIFMA is the leading trade association for broker-dealers, investment banks and asset managers operating in the 
U.S.  and  global  capital  markets.  On  behalf  of  our  industry's  one  million  employees,  we  advocate  on  legislation, 
regulation and business policy affecting retail and institutional investors, equity and fixed income markets and related 
products  and  services.  We  serve  as  an  industry  coordinating  body  to  promote  fair  and  orderly  markets,  informed 
regulatory compliance, and efficient market operations and resiliency. We also provide a forum for industry policy 
and professional development. SIFMA, with offices in New York and Washington, D.C., is the U.S. regional member

#1 Priorities 

FINRA Arbitration 

FINRA Rule 12000 and 13000 Series, FINRA Regulatory Notices (RN) (e.g., 16-25, 21-16), 
Discovery and Arbitrator's Guides, Codes of Arbitration Procedure 

Amend rules, guidance, procedures, and guides governing arbitration, with a focus on reforming 
FINRA’s arbitration process to achieve better and more fair outcomes. Recommendations 
include, but are not limited to, limiting punitive damages awards, enhancing arbitrator training 
and qualifications, improving the discovery and hearing processes, and addressing issues with 
the adjudication of Form U5 defamation claims (as raised in SIFMA's February 2024 comment 
letter). 

SLATE Rules and Securities Loan Reporting 

FINRA Rule 6500 Series and SEC Rule 10c-1a 

Request the SEC delay implementation of the final rule and rescind and re-issue amended rules, 
including FINRA rules. The current rules create a complex and burdensome reporting regime 
whose cost and burdens far outweigh any benefits to investors. Specifically, FINRA's rules 
require information in excess of the SEC's final rule and FINRA's fee schedule for SLATE will 
generate fees in excess of those required to run SLATE and inappropriately apportion costs 
between data submitters and data users. (See SIFMA's January 7 and April 1, 2022 and March 
15, 2023 comment letters on Rule 10c-1a, and May 28 and July 31, 2024 comment letters on 
FINRA's proposed SLATE Rules).  

Short Interest Position Reporting Requirements 

SEC Rule 13f-2 and Form SHO 

Work with the SEC to rescind and re-issue an amended rule to address concerns that key terms 
not clearly defined and confidential and proprietary information and strategies could be 
revealed. (See SIFMA's April 26, 2022 comment letter). Additionally, revised SEC rules should 
supersede FINRA's short position reporting requirements that the market reports under a single 
rule. 

TRACE Reporting Framework 

FINRA Rule 6700 Series 

Finalize rule proposal to rescind 1-minute reporting requirements for certain fixed income 
products under Rule 6730. Review the framework for simplification, including alignment with 
MSRB rules; rationalization of trade report flags; and addressing specific issues such as price 
out of range bands, affiliate trade dissemination, no remuneration indicator, etc. 

Examples:  

1 

 
 
•  When Issued (WI) flag and price type requirements for USTs (Rule 6730): The market 
views the WI security to be on the run (no longer WI) after the auction. Suggested 
changes: 1) Either allow firms to report both in yield and decimal price or no longer 
require the WI flag after auction date (i.e. after auction date = report with no WI flag and 
price type decimal); 2) if a client elects to trade the outstanding security ahead of an 
upcoming re-opening, and they choose settle date to match issue date, allow firms to 
automatically append the WI flag.   

•  TWEB fees on UST all-in vs. clean price (Rule 6730): update the TRACE Rules and/or 

FAQs to clarify if firms should be reporting clean price or all-in price. 

•  No Renumeration (Rule 6730): Rescind the rule. There does not seem to be a consistent 

FINRA examiner interpretation of when the indicator should be applied and the 
information provides no added value to the street/market participants/clients as the 
indicator would be duplicative (e.g., “A” indicator already displayed to the market for 
trades between BD and a non-member affiliate for an affiliate). Alternatively, narrow the 
scope for the indicator to only indicate a trade as part of a wrap arrangement, where 
commissions are covered by a monthly fee, for example."" 

Definition of ""Associated Person"" 

FINRA Rule 1011, Article 1 of FINRA By-Laws, and SEC Rule 3(a)(18) 

Narrow the definition of Associated Person (AP) to exclude operational support functions that 
have no direct interaction with customers, and harmonize disparate definitions that exist in the 
Exchange Act and FINRA’s By-Laws and rules, which create challenges in identifying the 
population who are subject to various requirements triggered by AP status (e.g., fingerprinting 
and screening for statutory disqualification, PAD, recordkeeping and reporting requirements, 
etc.). 

Fingerprinting 

Exchange Act § 17(f)(2) and SEC Rule 17f-2 

Address underlying interpretive questions regarding who is in scope for fingerprinting (see AP 
definition above) and questionable utility of fingerprint/FBI checks for individuals located 
outside the US, including conflicts with foreign privacy laws and regulations. Note, the SEC 
does not require fingerprinting of SBSD APs. 

Collateral Consequences/Statutory Disqualification (SD) and MC-400 Process 

Article III, Sections 3-4 of FINRA By-Laws, FINRA Rule 9520 Series, and Exchange Act § 
3(a)(39) of Exchange Act 

Consider a risk-based approach to heightened supervisory plan requirements for firms, including 
requirements imposed by other regulators, and the cadence of SD exams. 

2 

 
 
 
 
Margin/Day Trading Requirements 

FINRA Rules 4210, 2130, 2270 

Amend Rule 4210 to address SIFMA’s comments in 2021 and 2025 letters and to reflect 
investor preference for bank deposit settlement accounts. No requested changes to Rules 2130 or 
2270. 

Communications with the Public 

FINRA Rules 2210, 2214 

Align, where appropriate, Rules 2210 and 2214 with the SEC's Marketing Rule and MSRB 
requirements. For both retail and institutional investors, allow firms to take the same approach 
on determining whether to share hypothetical or targeted performance and whether to use 
investment tools as allowed under the Marketing Rule. 

Additionally, clarify whether and under what circumstances Rule 2210 applies to 
communications distributed by a firm that are clearly not related to its securities business. For 
example, dually-registered firms may issue communications on behalf of their advisory business 
that include references to underlying holdings, such as mutual funds, ETFs, or individual stocks 
or bonds, that are not a solicitation or offer of the referenced securities; this can be reinforced 
with a disclosure. 

Consolidated Audit Trail (CAT) 

SEC Rule 613 (CAT), FINRA Rules 8211, 8213 (Blue Sheets) 

The CAT is currently administered via an NMS Plan, which is governed by an Operating 
Committee consisting solely of representatives from the national securities exchanges and 
FINRA. The model, security, governance and funding of the CAT is fundamentally flawed and 
the SEC should conduct a comprehensive review of the CAT to determine its future. At the very 
least, the SEC should focus on updating its structure and operations to reduce costs and increase 
security, and update the governance and funding model to ensure that broker-dealers’ views are 
appropriately reflected and the SEC has funding responsibility given its use of the CAT. The 
SEC should eliminate electronic blue sheets and replace it with a system based on CAT data, 
eliminate the CAT customer and account information system (CAIS) in light of the changes that 
will discontinue the reporting of PII to the CAT,  and require the SROs to hire an independent 
party to review and make recommendations on ways to streamline and reduce costs associated 
with the CAT transactional database, the CAT transaction processing timelines, and the CAT 
database architecture in the cloud. The SEC should also adopt its 2020 CAT data security 
proposal, work with the SROs to add broker-dealer representatives to the CAT Operating 
Committee, and revisit and revise the CAT funding model and ultimately assume funding 
obligations for the CAT.      

FINRA should consider the utility of Rules 8211 and 8213 regarding submission of blue sheet 
data considering CAT. 

3 

 
 
Carrying Agreements 

FINRA Rule 4311 

Amend Rule 4311 and related guidance, including: 1) eliminating Rule 4311(h) because 
introducing firms already receive sufficient information from carrying firms through existing 
reporting protocols. (See SIFMA's 2018 comment letter); removing requirement in Rule 
4311(g)(1)(a) to provide regulator of foreign correspondent (introducing) broker with notice of a 
complaint against the introducing broker; and removing requirements in Rule 4311 (b)(2) and 
(b)(3) for FINRA’s approval of each introducing broker arrangement. 

Publication or Submission of Quotations 

SEC Rule 15c2-11 and FINRA Rule 6400 Series 

FINRA must work with SEC to remove all fixed income products from 15c2-11’s scope.   

Customer Account Transfer Contracts (ACATS) 

FINRA Rule 11870 

Modernize the ACATS requirements in Rule 11870 to address the evolving risks related to fraud 
(e.g., allow greater flexibility when fraud is suspected), reviewing how the rule comports with 
the existing framework on account transfers, including NSCC Rule 50. Clarify when a firm may 
take exceptions to ACATs when there is suspicion of fraud (e.g., Rule 11870(d)(3)), and define 
exception to Section (g) to return ACAT assets within 5-business days of receipt of an ACAT 
recall where the initial ACAT was identified / flagged as fraudulent money movement. In these 
instances, an investigation is needed to confirm the fraudulent nature of the event, and where a 
fraudster had successfully liquidated the account, the account would first need to be made whole 
before an ACAT return could be performed. 

Consider for industry comment uniform reporting under Rule 11870(b)(1), which requires a 
validation of the transfer instruction by the carrying firm to the receiving firm “with an 
attachment reflecting all positions and money balances to be transferred as shown on its books,” 
to reduce friction at the point of transfer with positions currently being reported differently. 

Cash/Non-Cash Compensation 

FINRA Rules 2310, 2320, 2340, 5110 

Modernize exceptions to prohibitions on non-cash compensation arrangements. 

Provide clarity on cash/non-cash applicability and consider whether there is an opportunity to 
consolidate the mutual fund and variable annuity rules, and address appropriate dollar limits.   

Provide clarity or examples of what is permissible as ""an occasional meal, a ticket to a sporting 
event or the theater or comparable entertainment which is neither so frequent nor so extensive as 
to raise any question of propriety and is not preconditioned on achievement of a sales target."" 
I.e., define forms of permissible and impermissible business entertainment based on the 
location, nature, frequency and dollar amount of the business entertainment provided, as well as 

4 

 
 
the type and dollar amount of any accommodations or transportation provided in connection 
with such business entertainment. 

Modernize ability to make payments to DBAs, which is not prohibited for advisory payments to 
DBAs. 

Remove reference to ""included on the member's books and records."" In many instances, held-
away positions are reflected on stock record to reflect the positions on statements below the line. 

Reporting Requirements/Records of Written Customer Complaints 

FINRA Rules 4530, 4513 

Amend the definition of ""complaint."" The term should be well-defined because it is overly broad 
and pre-dates social media and other technologies that have made it more commonplace for 
people to express dissatisfaction without the desire or expectation of a remedy. Reporting should 
be limited to complaints: 1) of a verified client; 2) that are clearly directed at the firm; (3) that 
identify specific issues; and (4) that request some action and/or compensation. 

#2 Priorities 

Third Party Risk Management 

FINRA Rule 3110 and RN 21-29 

Consistent with a narrowing of the definition of AP above, provide guidance on roles and 
responsibilities that would define a third-party as an AP as well as the scope of responsibility for 
supervision and compliance with applicable FINRA rules. Provide observed practices on 
reviewing vendors, including what is considered a reasonable review and the frequency thereof. 

Best Execution 

FINRA Rule 5310 

Amend Supplementary Material (SM) .09, which lists certain factors that should be considered 
when performing a regular and rigorous review of execution quality. While these factors may be 
appropriate for assessing smaller retail orders, each factor is not necessarily appropriate or 
effective in assessing the execution quality of larger institutional orders, in particular those 
handled via an algorithm.   

Clarify that existing guidance (SM .04) exempts single-dealer platforms from Rule 5310. 

Customer Confirmations  

FINRA Rule 2232 and SEC Rule 10b-10 

High priority: rescind disclosure of markup/markdown on retail customer confirmations, which 
is highly burdensome. Similarly, institutional accounts which are not “functionally separate” (as 
explained in the next paragraph) should have the option to opt-out, given these accounts already 
receive daily reporting, but FINRA will need to coordinate any changes with the SEC on Rule 
10b-10.  

5 

 
 
 
Secondary priority for fixed income confirmations: it is common for ""retail"" and ""institutional"" 
fixed income desks within a firm to trade with each other on arm's-length terms, each with no 
knowledge of the other's transactions to source or resell such securities. The desks may be 
located in separate affiliated member entities or the same member entity. While we are aware 
that FAQ 1.2.1 takes the view that transactions between different desks of the same member 
entity are not transactions under the Rule, we nonetheless believe that economic outcomes to the 
end client should be the same as long as the proper information walls and other arms-length 
safeguards are in place.  Under current rules the former case is eligible for the 2232(d)(1) 
exception while the latter case currently is not, resulting in an artificial distinction for purposes 
of mark-up and mark-down disclosure whereby the member in the latter case must disclose a 
misleadingly high mark-up or mark-down to customers. This undermines the usefulness of the 
disclosures to customers and inadvertently puts the latter firm at a competitive disadvantage.   
Amend FAQ items 1.2.1 and 1.7 to permit reliance on the 2232(d)(1) """"functionally separate"""" 
exception where the principal trading desk that executes the (non-institutional) customer 
transaction in a given security either: (a) purchased the security from a """"functionally separate"""" 
principal trading desk within the same member entity (in the case of a customer purchase); or 
(b) resells the security to a """"functionally separate"""" principal trading desk within the same 
member entity (in the case of a customer sale); in each case where the latter (non-customer-
facing) principal trading desk has no knowledge of the customer transaction.  

Secondary priority: adopt additional standards similar to MSRB G-33 for the decimalization of 
display on confirm for accrued interest and yield (YTM or YTW). 

Anti-Money Laundering 

FINRA Rule 3310 

FINRA should avoid duplication when examining firms for BSA compliance as it relates to 
manipulative trading or cyber-crimes, to the extent it is occurring. 

Coordinate with federal regulators to ensure consistency of BSA interpretations and reduce 
duplicative, inefficient exams. Additionally, coordinate and jointly issue guidance/notices with 
the SEC and make available in a centralized location. 

MSRB Rule Violations 

FINRA should consult with the MSRB on findings related to alleged violations of MSRB Rules. 
Industry members have concerns about recent FINRA examination findings and enforcement 
actions that appear to be inconsistent with MSRB Rules and guidance (e.g., time of trade 
reporting, use of list offering price indicator, and reporting of allocations). 

#3 Priorities 

Client Statements 

FINRA Rule 2231 and NYSE Rule 409T 

Allow more flexibility beyond the current exception for firms to stop sending statements to a 
client. Expand Limited Exception to Continuous Statement Delivery Requirement to include, 
where court appointed fiduciary is not already in place or is in process, re-direction of client 

6 

 
 
statements to a documented, vetted POA after verification of client’s incapacity with an 
independent third-party (doctor, etc.).  
Provide an option for institutional clients to suppress their client statements. 

Relatedly, amend Rule 2231 to allow for default suppression (or electronic access) for 
institutional accounts (as defined in 2111(b). These clients do not custody positions; thus, 
account statements only show trading activity. Pertinent information is already included in the 
trading confirmations. Brokers have had to build the infrastructure to generate account 
statements with duplicative information without tangible client benefit. 

Options 

FINRA Rule 2360 and RN 22-14 

Cancel proposed OTC Options Trade Reporting Requirements in RN 22-14. 

Amend OTC Options Position Limits (b)(3), Current Disclosure Documents (b)(11), and 
Options Complaints Records (b)(17) sections: 

• 

• 

• 

(b)(3): increase listed and OTC options position limits in US listed equities and ETFs. 
Eliminate or increase OTC options position limits in foreign listed equities and ETFs.  
Need exchanges to agree to limits for listed options. 
(b)(11): ODD Disclosure delivery should be permitted electronically without written 
consent.  Currently, it requires delivery of 100+ page document at setup of account, and 
re-sending with updates.  
(b)(17): remove additional options related complaints documentation requirements; 
harmonize with standard complaint reporting and recordkeeping 

Amend delta hedge position limit exemption in (b)(3)(A)(ii)(b). This exemption should be 
available to positions originating from clients meeting the definition of institutional account 
under FINRA rules. For consistency across the industry, the applicable model for this category 
of trading activity, i.e., institutional client flow, can be the publicly available OCC model rather 
than the proprietary models used by clearing firms. Additional, amend (b)(18(A)(ii) to clearly 
state that rule applies to discretionary brokerage accounts only.  

BD SBS Margin Requirements 

FINRA Rule 4240 

Inter-affiliate transactions should be exempted as they are under CFTC, USPR and SEC rules. 

Amend Rule 4240 to track SEC margin requirements for security-based swap dealers, and 
exclude non-dealer SBS activity. 

A broker-dealer already registered as a Swap Dealer Mixed Swaps should be exempt because 
the SEC and CFTC agreed that a SD that is not dual registered will treat Mixed Swaps like 
CFTC swaps for UMR purposes. 

Align FINRA 4240 to SEC view on risk of inter-affiliate transactions and its treatment of mixed 

7 

 
 
 
 
 
   
 
swaps is inconsistent with the SEC/CFTC agreement regarding shared jurisdiction over such 
derivatives. 

Net Capital Requirements  

SEC Rule 15c3-1 and FINRA Rule 4120 

Consolidate and harmonize capital notification requirements in FINRA Rule 4120 with other 
regulators/SROs/exchanges/clearing houses to serve the purpose of capital notification 
requirements: ensuring firms have sufficient capital.   

Customer Protection Rule 

SEC Rule 15c3-3 and FINRA RN 21-27 

Rule 15c3-3 states that broker-dealers must provide 30 days’ notice when changing a sweep 
product. In early 2021, FINRA put out an interpretation RN 21-27 (as communicated to FINRA 
by the SEC Staff) saying this included adding or removing any bank from an FDIC sweep 
program. This requirement is unworkable in some circumstances when a bank is removed from 
the sweep program due to bank failure and FDIC receivership (e.g., Silicon Valley Bank). 

Fractional Share Trading  

FINRA Rule 6282 (ADF), FINRA Rule 6380A (FINRA/Nasdaq TRF), FINRA Rule 6380B 
(FINRA/NYSE TRF), and Rule 6622 (OTC Reporting Facility) 

Enhance fractional trade reporting to FINRA trade reporting facilities.  Currently, TRFs do not 
support entry of fractional share quantities. 

Work with the SEC and DOL to align principal trading requirements across frameworks to 
support principal trading to enable fractional shares in advisory accounts and investment 
companies.  Currently, certain types of advisory clients, such as retirement plans subject to 
ERISA and SEC-registered investment companies, may need to comply with regulations that 
generally prohibit or restrict them from engaging in principal trades, cross trades, or both, with 
some exceptions. Regulators should allow for trades in principal capacity inside qualified, fee-
based accounts and without waiver on non-qualified (where client needs to approve principal 
trading on account open and trade-by-trade) to support fractional share trading and fixed income 
products within qualified or advisory accounts. 

Beneficial Interest Requirements - Accounts At Other Broker-Dealers and Financial 
Institutions 

FINRA Rule 3210 

Amend rule as it relates to the breadth of spousal accounts for purposes of defining “beneficial 
interest” which a registered person is presumed to have, thereby creating additional review, 
approval, and monitoring requirements for firms. Recommend a centralized database to report 
accounts, instead of going to each firm, with consistent requirements. 

8 

 
 
 
 
Guidance on Investment Advisory Activities  

FINRA NTMs 96-33 and 94-44 

Update and further clarify the guidance related to rules governing RR/IAs. These regulatory 
notices are relied upon today, nearly 30 years later, and can stand to benefit from modernized 
guidance regarding investment advisory activities of RRs who are also investment advisers. 

Searchable FINRA decisions 

Make FINRA decisions (arbitration awards, enforcement actions, etc.) searchable as they are in 
Lexis or Westlaw. The PDF postings are inefficient. 

Other Priorities 

Cross-Border Activity of Non-US BDs 

SEC Rule 15a-6 

The rule needs to be modernized to account for current business practices and relief provided in 
No Action Letters. 

Confirmation of Transactions 

SEC Rule 10b-10 

Modernize for default electronic delivery over physical delivery for institutional client trade 
confirmations (and client account statements). Potentially have different default positions for 
retail versus institutional clients.  

Form BD Instructions 

Form BD Instructions - Section C.1.D (Electronic Filing Instructions, retention of paper copies) 

Align with Forms U4 and U5 requirements by removing requirement to store paper copies of 
initial BD filings and amendments to Disclosure Reporting Pages. 

Customer Account Information 

FINRA Rule 4512 

Amend rule to: 1) harmonize FINRA definitions to SEC definitions (Reg BI, Accredited 
Investor) for more consistent application across definitions; and 2) combine various customer 
and investment profile information into Rule 4512, and for areas where customer account 
information is required in other rules (2111, 3010, 3260, refer to Rule 4512.  

Provide guidance on whether representation by an RIA effectively turns any customer into an 
“institutional account” (similar to the retail customer definition exclusion for Reg BI). 

9 

 
 
 
 
Displaying OTC Equity Quotations in Multiple Quotation Mediums 

FINRA Rule 6438 

Rule 6438 requires members that display priced quotations on a real-time basis for an OTC 
equity security in two or more quotation mediums to display the same priced quotations for the 
security in each medium, with an exception for certain quotations that represent a customer 
limit order. Given inability to mark an order as “representative” in CAT, FINRA should update 
the rule to delete the reference to “represent.” 

BrokerCheck  

RN 19-10 

Rescind RN 19-10 guidance on customer communications relating to departing registered 
representatives (RR).  In particular, FINRA stated that a member firm must provide contra firm 
contact information for the departing representative (with his/her consent) to clients when the 
RR leaves for another firm. This is operationally challenging because it can conflict with other 
notice periods and/or Garden Leave requirements memorialized in private employment 
agreements.    

Trade Halts 

FINRA Rule 6440(c)  

FINRA should provide clarity on what is prohibited during a trading halt (the language "" to 
effect, directly or indirectly, a trade…"" is vague) and what obligation(s) a firm has if a market 
center executes a trade during a halt. To avoid disadvantaging customers when the halt ends, 
FINRA should confirm that a member firm can route orders for execution post-halt. 

Letter of Free Funds 

SEC Regulation T 

Section 220.8 (2) requires the firm to send letters of free funds (LOFFs) to confirm clients have 
sufficient funds on hand to settle transactions. In the current T+1 environment, this requirement 
is ineffectual because the contra broker will action the trade on T+1 if there were insufficient 
funds in the client’s account, which is typically before LOFFs get acknowledged/returned. 

606 Reports 

SEC Rule 606 

The Rule requires broker-dealers to prepare and publish quarterly reports related to their routing 
decisions and the relationships between the broker-dealer and the routing destinations. 
Considering the various interpretive questions and positions taken by firms in preparing these 
reports, it would be most effective for FINRA or the SEC to prepare these reports based on a 
review of CAT data.  This would allow for a consistent methodology to be applied across firms, 
providing market participants an apples-to-apples comparison of routing activity across firms. 

10 

 
 
Large Trader Monitoring 

SEC Rule 13h-1(f)(3) 

To qualify for the safe harbor and not be deemed to know the LT status of a client, a broker-
dealer must have policies and procedures designed to identify  those who have not complied 
with the identification requirements and, under (f)(3), must notify those clients of their 
obligations to identify as an LT with the SEC. With CAT data, this information is directly 
available to regulators and so the onus should no longer fall on broker-dealers to notify clients 
of their obligations. 

Form ADV Application for Investment Advisor 
Form ADVW Application for Investment Advisor Withdrawal 

SEC Rules 204-2, 275.0-4(a)(2), and 275.203-1(1) 

The SEC should consider storage of the Form ADV and ADVW and it's amendments within the 
IARD system to comply with the record keeping requirements of these forms.   

Restrictions on the Purchase and Sale of Initial Equity Public Offerings- Issuer-Directed 
Securities 

FINRA Rule 5130(d)(1)(B) 

Rule 5130(d) implicitly and correctly recognizes that issuer-directed allocations do not raise the 
same conflicts of interest as IPO allocations made at the discretion of a member or a member 
associated person. It is unclear why the rule excludes two classes of ""restricted person"" from the 
issuer-directed exception, frequently preventing issuers from directing allocations to accounts in 
which an employee (or immediate family member of an employee) of a broker-dealer has a 
beneficial interest. In practice this has caused members to reject issuer-directed allocations 
merely because the recipient's spouse happens to work for a broker-dealer that is not involved in 
the new issue, and in a role unrelated to securities underwriting.  

Delete paragraph (d)(1)(B) (""an account in which any restricted person specified in paragraphs 
(i)(10)(B) or (i)(10)(C) of this Rule has a beneficial interest, unless such person, or a member of 
his or her immediate family, is an employee or director of the issuer, the issuer's parent, or a 
subsidiary of the issuer or the issuer's parent, or of a franchisee of any of the foregoing entities. 
Also, for purposes of this paragraph (d)(1) only, a parent/subsidiary relationship is established if 
the parent has the right to vote 50% or more of a class of voting security of the subsidiary, or 
has the power to sell or direct 50% or more of a class of voting security of the subsidiary""). 

If FINRA does not wish to delete paragraph (d)(1)(B) entirely, an alternative would be to limit 
the cross-reference to paragraph (i)(10)(B) to allocations to personnel of the managing 
underwriter of the new issue.  

Electronic Submission of SEC Forms ATS and ATS-R 

SEC Rule 301 

Under Regulation ATS, broker-dealer operators of certain types of ATSs must file a Form ATS 
and quarterly Form ATS-R with the SEC.  These forms must be executed by a supervisor and 

11 

 
 
 
notarized and cannot be done electronically. These signature and notary requirements are 
outdated and add complexity to the process.  Allow electronic filing like Form ATS-N. 

FINRA Membership/Filing Fees 

Reassess inputs for membership fees.  Fees based on branches rather than number of registered 
persons unfairly elevate payments by firms who serve investors in person across locations and 
decrease payments for firms who may have the same number or registered reps from a few 
branch locations or that substantially serve investors through on-line platforms. 

FINRA imposes fees based on a notice and comment process but does not necessarily revise 
fees to incorporate industry feedback when fees are in excess of FINRA's stated needs.  All 
changes to FINRA fees should require public comment and SEC oversight for reasonableness.   

Alternative Display Facility 

FINRA Rule 6200 Series 

Consider whether this is necessary to maintain. 

Wet Signature Requirements 

Revisit and remove any wet signature requirements given current practices.  

General Clock Sync Rule 

FINRA Rule 4590 

Update the rule to reflect scenarios where firms do not have their own clocks and rely on 
clearing BDs. 

Market Surveillance  

Provide more clarity of the range of thresholds that should be applied when monitoring for 
market abuse/manipulation. 

Data Security 

EBS/LOPR/etc. 

Regulators require firms to report all manners of non-public trading information. While data 
security has been front and center in the context of CAT, it is equally important for other legacy 
systems/reporting structures and regulators should ensure data security for legacy systems/data. 

Restricted Stock 

SEC Rule 144 

Address FINRA's position that treats the executing broker as the gatekeeper and liable for 
violations of Rule 144 even if other actors have intentionally or mistakenly made errors that 
would be difficult for the executing broker to recognize.

Members' Responsibilities Regarding Deferred Variable Annuities 

FINRA Rule 2330 

Revise the requirement in 2330(c) that requires principal review and approval ""Prior to 
transmitting a customer's application for a deferred variable annuity to the issuing insurance 
company for processing, but no later than seven business days....."" to 30 days. 

Monthly Report of Margin Account Balances & Margin Disclosure Statements 

FINRA Rules 2264 & 4521(d)(2)  

Revise the rule to be consistent with industry practices. The information required by 4521(d) is 
reported at an account level and doe not represent actual debit or credit balance carried at a fund 
level. Prime clients generally calculate interest at a contract family level and not at an account 
level.  As such, the information provided to regulators is not necessarily consistent with industry 
practices. 

Periodic Security Counts, Verifications and Comparisons 

FINRA Rule 4522 

Provide an exception for the monthly count for products that do not create/provide monthly 
statement files, which is an issue in the alternative investment space.  

Consolidated Financial Account Reports 

FINRA RN 10-19 

The regulatory framework established in 2010 under RN 10-19 no longer reflects the practical 
realities of current business practices. The expectations surrounding “consolidated reports” have 
become difficult to apply in a technology-driven environment where automated data feeds, 
APIs, and dynamic client dashboards are standard. As a result, firms are challenged to align with 
the letter of the guidance while meeting client expectations for a modern, digital-first financial 
experience. Under a strict reading of the RN 10-19, nearly every output from a tool could fall 
within the definition of a consolidated report, triggering heightened supervisory obligations. 
This creates tension between compliance requirements and effective client service, particularly 
when the communications are illustrative. 

Bulk Transfer of Customer Accounts 

Codify in a FINRA rule: (i) the circumstances under which a FINRA member can rely on 
customer negative consent to effectuate a bulk transfer of customer accounts to another FINRA 
member, and (ii) the minimum disclosures that must be included in the negative consent letter to 
customers. Eliminate FINRA’s review and “non-objection” to the use of negative consent and 
the contents of the negative consent letter, so long as the transferring firm complies with the 
standards articulated in the rule. 

NASDAQ Listing Rules 

NASDAQ's current listing requirements should be revised to mitigate opportunities for fraud 
and abuse.

Definition of SEC ""Access Person"" 

Advisers Act Rule 204A-1  

Clarify the definition of ""Access Person"" and expectations of adviser review, in particular  
holdings and transactions.  

Disclosure of Order Execution Information 

Regulation NMS Rule 605 

Delay implementation beyond the December 2025 compliance effective date because the 
technical specifications for the format of the vendor report are not ready. Additionally, the SEC 
needs to update, consolidate and restate FAQs on Rule 605. There should be more detailed 
discussion on IOCs with additional special handling instructions to ensure consistency in 
industry approach to allow for parity in measuring cross-industry statistics. 

Pay to Play 

SEC Rule 206(4)-5 and FINRA Rule 2030 

The SEC rule should be rescinded, and FINRA make conforming changes to its rule. The caps 
implemented under the rule are arbitrary and the penalties are out of step with the violation.

Re: FINRA Regulatory Notice 25-04 – Request for Comment on Modernizing FINRA Rules (Comment 
Period Ending June 11, 2025) 

Dear Ms. Mitchell: 

We appreciate the opportunity to comment on FINRA’s Regulatory Notice 25-04, which proposes a 
broad review to modernize FINRA rules and regulatory frameworks applicable to member firms and 
associated persons. Apex Clearing Corporation (“Apex”) commends FINRA for its forward-thinking 
approach to tailoring regulatory requirements to technological advancements, market evolution, and 
operational changes. 

The comments below address specific questions and request areas raised in the Notice, along with 
additional suggestions that we believe align with FINRA’s mission of protecting investors and promoting 
market integrity. 

We strongly support FINRA’s focus on modernizing its regulatory framework to reflect the evolving 
financial services landscape and reduce unnecessary burdens on member firms, while continuing to 
uphold robust investor protections. Specifically, we commend FINRA’s recognition of the importance of 
innovation, adoption of new technologies, and adaptation to modern workplace practices to ensure a 
competitive and fair marketplace.

Artificial Intelligence 

As part of this modernization effort, we urge FINRA to consider revising its rules to encourage and 
facilitate the rapidly expanding use of artificial intelligence (AI) in financial services and the significant 
opportunities it presents for the industry. AI-driven tools are revolutionizing many aspects of the 
financial services ecosystem, including but not limited to: 

  Reducing Costs: AI enables firms to analyze vast amounts of data efficiently, improving decision-
making, fraud detection, and compliance monitoring, all while cutting back on expensive manual 
processes. 

  Enhancing Customer Service and Experience: AI allows for personalized financial advice, chatbot 
functionalities, and predictive analytics that offer superior and tailored customer experiences in 
real time. 
Increasing Operational Efficiency and Reducing Errors: Integrating AI into back-office functions 
and operational workflows can streamline processes, reduce human error, and allow firms to 
manage risk more effectively. 

 

However, the use of AI also raises important regulatory and compliance questions, such as ensuring 
fairness, transparency, data security, and accountability, which should be considered as part of FINRA’s 
modernization initiative. We appreciate that FINRA issued Regulatory Notice 24-09 (FINRA Reminds 
Members of Regulatory Obligations When Using Generative Artificial Intelligence and Large Language 
Models) on June 27, 2024, which presents risks relating to this technology and reminders of member 
firm obligations. Additionally, FINRA published a whitepaper titled Artificial Intelligence (AI) in the 
Securities Industry on June 10, 2020, which: (a) briefly defines AI and its scope as it pertains to the 
securities industry; (b) provides an overview of broker-dealers’ use of AI applications related to: (i) 
communications with customers, (ii) investment processes, and (iii) operational functions; and (c) 
discusses key factors including potential regulatory considerations, securities market participants may 
want to consider as they develop and adopt AI-based tools. Moreover, we believe that FINRA should 
publish updated guidance on the appropriate uses and limitations of AI that would support both firms 
and investors in navigating this transformative and quickly evolving technology. Specifically, FINRA 
surveyed its member firms on the use of AI through the 2025 Third Vendor Questionnaire as well as ad 
hoc requests and discussions facilitated by FINRA’s Risk Monitoring team. FINRA should publish its 
observations from these studies, including themes, common use cases, pitfalls, and areas of concern. 

Investor Communications 

We encourage FINRA to address how the modes of interaction and communication between brokers 
and investors have dramatically evolved over the last decade. Real-time messaging platforms, push 
notifications, and app-based communication are becoming central to client engagement, while the use 
of traditional communication channels, such as physical mail and email, is rapidly declining. FINRA 
____________________________________________________________________________

________ 

www.apexfintechsolutions.com 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
should specifically revise its rules to permit statements, confirms, and other investor notifications be 
delivered by push notifications and other app-based communication means.  

These advancements in communication technology not only improve clients’ access to timely and 
relevant information but also enhance transparency and responsiveness. However, the increased use of 
these newer communication tools necessitates updated rules and guidance regarding recordkeeping, 
supervision, and compliance to ensure that regulatory requirements keep pace with these innovations. 
It is important that FINRA establish clear retention guidelines for these electronic communications that 
take into account technological and practical considerations while acknowledging the underlying and 
core principles behind long-standing rules. 

By addressing these technological and behavioral shifts, FINRA can help foster a regulatory environment 
that better aligns with modern market realities, encourages innovation, and supports member firms in 
serving their clients effectively and efficiently. 

Licensing and Registration 

As part of FINRA’s efforts to modernize its regulatory framework, we respectfully request FINRA also 
prioritize a review of the licensing requirements for brokerage employees. The current rules governing 
which brokerage employees are required to be licensed, as well as which specific licenses are needed, 
create unnecessary complexity and confusion for member firms. The overlap between multiple license 
categories often leads to inefficiencies and raises questions about tasks that must be performed by 
licensed individuals versus those that may be conducted by unregistered personnel under supervision, a 
distinction that is not always clear under the current framework. Additionally, most of the licensing 
exam content can be modernized for how registered people actually conduct business today. 

The rapidly evolving role of technology in financial services has further complicated the application of 
licensing rules. Tasks that historically required the oversight or direct action of licensed operations 
professionals are increasingly automated or, in the future, may even be carried out by advanced agentic 
AI systems. These technological advancements raise critical questions about the rationale and 
applicability of existing licensing rules. For instance, if an unlicensed person cannot perform a manual 
task, yet the same task can be executed by an automated system—such as algorithm-driven trade 
reconciliations or risk monitoring—questions arise as to whether FINRA’s licensing requirements are 
suited to the modern workplace. 

We believe it is both practical and necessary to revisit the current licensing framework to account for 
technological advancements that reduce or eliminate the need for human intervention in routine 
operational or compliance tasks. Specifically, the focus of licensing requirements should evolve to 
ensure that individuals responsible for supervising or overseeing automated systems, including agentic 
AI, are appropriately credentialed and qualified, without unnecessarily requiring other roles or 
processes that no longer involve human decision-making to be burdened with licensing requirements. 

____________________________________________________________________________

________ 

www.apexfintechsolutions.com 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
FINRA has the opportunity to realign licensing standards with today’s technological reality by: 

  Clarifying Standards for Licensing Requirements: Providing clarification on which tasks must still 
be performed or overseen by a licensed individual and which fall outside the scope of licensing 
due to automation or the capabilities of advanced AI.  

  Recognizing the Role of AI in Operational Functions: Acknowledging the ability of agentic AI 
systems to carry out specific tasks traditionally performed by humans and clarifying that the 
licensing requirement should apply only to individuals responsible for supervising or approving 
those AI-driven processes. For instance, a licensing framework where the ultimate responsibility 
lies with the registered supervisor of the AI system—rather than requiring all individuals working 
within a system dominated by AI to maintain licenses—would be more in line with 
contemporary practices. 

  Streamlining Licensing Categories: Reducing overlaps between various licensing categories, such 

as the SIE, Series 7, Series 24, Series 99, and other specialized licenses, which create 
administrative burdens without offering a corresponding benefit to investor protection or 
market integrity.  

By addressing these issues, FINRA can modernize its licensing framework in a way that meets its goals of 
protecting investors and ensuring market integrity without stifling innovation or imposing unnecessary 
burdens on member firms. Not only will this provide clarity and consistency, but it will also allow 
member firms to allocate resources more effectively to supervisory and compliance oversight in the 
areas of greatest importance. 

This revision highlights both the opportunities and challenges AI and evolving communication methods 
bring, maintaining alignment with FINRA’s objectives while positioning the client as technologically 
forward-looking and investor-focused. 

ACATs 

Apex urges FINRA to prioritize reforming the rules governing Automated Customer Account Transfers 
(ACATs), as the current framework creates significant vulnerabilities for fraud that are increasingly 
difficult for member firms to mitigate. While the ACATs system facilitates seamless and efficient 
customer account transfers when functioning properly, the rigid timeframes prescribed by existing rules, 
coupled with misaligned incentives among parties involved, have made it challenging to appropriately 
detect and address fraudulent activity in a timely manner. 

The current ACATs framework places sending firms, receiving firms, and clearinghouses in situations 
where systemic fraud can and has proliferated, with limited options for immediate response once an 
ACAT request has been initiated. Specifically: 

____________________________________________________________________________

________ 

www.apexfintechsolutions.com 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  Prescribed Timeframes and Deficiencies in Fraud Prevention: The strict timeframes for ACAT 
processing often do not provide sufficient opportunity for sending firms to adequately 
investigate and verify suspected fraudulent requests. This compressed timeline can lead to 
fraudulent transfers being processed before appropriate action can be taken. Fraud detection 
processes are further hindered by the lack of flexibility in rejecting ACAT requests for suspected 
fraud, forcing firms to comply with transfers they believe may lead to harm. 

  Misaligned Incentives: Sending firms are often responsible for identifying potential fraudulent 

requests but lack proper mechanisms to challenge or halt transfers in real time. Receiving firms 
are not well positioned to identify potentially fraudulent requests given their potentially short 
relationship with their new customer, and limited, validated information. Notwithstanding that 
receiving firms ultimately bear responsibility under current asymmetrical rules. 

 

Lack of Reporting Requirements and Data Transparency: No formal framework requires firms to 
report incidents of fraud related to ACATs or to share related statistics with FINRA. This lack of 
data hinders FINRA’s ability to gain comprehensive insight into the scope and systemic risks 
posed by ACAT-related fraud. 

In light of these challenges, we respectfully urge FINRA to modernize its rules governing ACATs to better 
align with the evolving fraud landscape and account for technological and operational realities. 
Specifically, we request that FINRA implement the following changes: 

  Extend Timeframes for Fraud Detection and Review: Adjust mandatory ACAT processing 

timeframes to allow firms greater opportunity to investigate and prevent fraudulent activity 
before transfers are completed. 

  Permit Firms to Reject ACAT Requests for Reasonable Fraud Suspicion: Provide firms with the 
authority to reject ACAT requests when reasonable fraud concerns are identified, rather than 
forcing firms to comply with transfers that they believe are invalid or harmful. 

  Require Sending Firms to Validate Instructions Directly with Customers: Establish a requirement 

for sending firms to verify transfer instructions directly with customers, using secure 
communication methods, before initiating or completing an ACAT transfer. 

  Mandate Fraud Incident Reporting: Require firms to report incidents of ACAT-related fraud and 
fraud prevention statistics to FINRA. This measure would provide FINRA with greater visibility 
into fraud trends and allow for a more strategic and data-driven approach to addressing ACAT 
fraud risks. 

  Coordinate with the NSCC to Modernize Liability Rules and Processes: FINRA should work 
collaboratively with the National Securities Clearing Corporation (NSCC) to update NSCC’s 

____________________________________________________________________________

________ 

www.apexfintechsolutions.com 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
liability framework for ACAT-related fraud to align with FINRA’s updated rules. A modernized 
liability structure would account for the responsibility of all parties involved in the ACAT process, 
promoting a more equitable allocation of risk and incentivizing all participants to take fraud 
prevention seriously. 

These recommendations would increase the security and integrity of the ACATs process, ensuring that 
member firms can better protect their customers from financial harm while maintaining a system that is 
efficient and investor-focused. By empowering firms with improved fraud prevention capabilities and 
requiring transparency in reporting fraud incidents, FINRA can further its mission to protect investors 
and uphold the integrity of the marketplace. Additionally, collaboration with NSCC to adjust liability 
rules will ensure consistency across the broader ACAT ecosystem. 

Disclosures of Associated Persons 

1. Outside Business Activities (FINRA Rule 3270) 
Modernizing the rules surrounding outside business activity disclosures would greatly enhance clarity 
and reduce unnecessary burdens for registered representatives (RRs) and their member firms. 
Specifically, these disclosures should focus on activities that meaningfully compete with or conflict with 
securities-related duties without regard to the number of hours, including hours during securities 
trading hours, unless it demonstrably impacts the RR’s responsibilities. Next, it would be beneficial to 
clarify whether work conducted for affiliates or subsidiaries of the employer firm qualifies as “outside” 
business that requires disclosure and particularly affiliates with which a RR is dually-registered. Many 
affiliates, though technically separately registered entities, function closely with a firm’s operations and 
may not warrant the same disclosure scrutiny. Lastly, routine or negligible activities should not require 
disclosure, as they pose minimal risk or conflict. Examples include managing a short-term rental 
property or infrequent activities that include nominal compensation, like pet sitting. Establishing a 
minimum threshold for hours, compensation, or materiality of these activities would streamline the 
process and minimize procedural inefficiencies. FINRA should consider revising the rule to focus 
disclosure requirements on activities that present genuine potential for conflicts of interest or 
interference with securities-related duties. 

2. Private Securities Transactions (FINRA Rule 3280) 
The definition and supervisory requirements surrounding private securities transactions would benefit 
from greater granularity and differentiation. Specifically, making a personal investment in a private 
entity should not always be equated with potential “selling away” activities. This is especially relevant in 
cases where RRs or firms have no sales-related role or supervisory responsibilities for the investment. 
Differentiating personnel making passive investments from those actively marketing or negotiating 
private transactions would reduce unnecessary supervisory burdens without compromising investor 
protection. Firms would benefit from a tailored supervision framework that distinguishes between 
passive private investments (e.g., angel investments or personal stakes in start-ups) and active sales-
related activities. This differentiation could help eliminate blanket reviews or restrictions on benign 
transactions that present little risk to the firm or public.  
____________________________________________________________________________

3. Accounts at Other Broker-Dealers (FINRA Rule 3210) 
As modern family structures and financial arrangements evolve, the rules surrounding employee trading 
account monitoring would benefit from adjustments to reflect these changes. Supplementary 
Material .02 of FINRA Rule 3210 provides that “an associated person need not be presumed to have a 
beneficial interest in, or to have established, an account if the associated person demonstrates, to the 
reasonable satisfaction of the employer member, that the associated person derives no economic 
benefit from, and exercises no control over, the account.” FINRA should define “beneficial interest” and 
provide further guidance on how an associated person should sufficiently demonstrate that he or she 
services no economic benefit from, and exercises no control over, an account as defined in Rule 3210. 
Additionally, FINRA should clarify expectations around college-aged children who are living away from 
home but remain financially dependent on their parent who is an RR. Finally, FINRA should clarify 
whether Rule 3210 applies to non-U.S securities transactions and permit more discretion and risk-based 
reviews of personal trading monitoring to prevent conflicts of interest and misuse of confidential 
information. That is, not all member firms have the same risks relating to investment banking and 
research, frontrunning, et cetera.  

4. Gifts, Gratuities and Entertainment 
We support FINRA’s previous consideration around updating its rules around entertainment to better 
reflect current business practices and promote clarity in application. In addition to the proposed 
changes to FINRA Rule 3220 that FINRA filed with the SEC on May 29, 2025 (SR-FINRA-2025-003 ), we 
urge FINRA to produce clearer guidance on what constitutes a permissible pattern of entertainment 
would help prevent inadvertent violations in a competitive environment where relationship-building 
often necessitates incremental ongoing interactions. Furthermore, FINRA rules should provide 
exceptions for giving or receiving gifts and entertainment to or from non-regulated third parties, such as 
vendors, consultants, law firms, etc. with which securities-related conflicts of interest are highly unlikely 
to arise, as well as sponsorships of client-approved charitable initiatives or participation in educational 
or training sessions that are not intended to materially benefit an individual. 

Fractional Share Trading 

As fractional share trading has become increasingly common among retail investors, the current 
limitations of Trade Reporting Facilities (TRFs) in supporting fractional share quantities no longer align 
with the realities of today’s market. Fractional share trading has democratized investing by enabling 
smaller investors to participate in the ownership of high-value securities, enhancing accessibility and 
promoting broader market participation. Despite these benefits, the inability of TRFs to allow for the 
reporting of fractional share quantities introduces inefficiencies and inconsistencies in the trade 
reporting and regulatory framework. 

Under the current regulatory environment, FINRA member firms are unable to report trades involving 
fractional share quantities through Trade Reporting Facilities, which poses operational challenges and 
leads to potential gaps in trade data. This issue becomes even more significant as the adoption of 
____________________________________________________________________________

________ 

www.apexfintechsolutions.com 

 
 
 
 
 
 
fractional shares continues to grow, accelerated by the emergence of app-based trading platforms and 
services that cater to retail investors. To address this gap and facilitate a regulatory framework that 
reflects modern trading practices, we urge FINRA to amend its rules to explicitly allow for the entry and 
reporting of fractional share quantities. Specifically, we recommend that FINRA update the following 
rules: 

1.  FINRA Rule 6282 (Alternative Display Facility (ADF)): Amend this rule to permit reporting of 

trades involving fractional shares on the ADF. Fractional shares frequently involve off-exchange 
transactions, making it essential for the ADF to fully accommodate these trades. 

2.  FINRA Rule 6380A (FINRA/Nasdaq TRF): Modify this rule to allow for the entry of fractional 

share quantities on the Nasdaq TRF, particularly as Nasdaq platforms are often utilized by retail-
focused broker-dealers that heavily support fractional share programs. 

3.  FINRA Rule 6380B (FINRA/NYSE TRF): Update this rule to mirror the capabilities of the Nasdaq 

TRF, enabling the reporting of trades involving fractional shares on the NYSE TRF, where 
applicable. 

4.  FINRA Rule 6622 (OTC Reporting Facility): Provide amendments to this rule to ensure that trades 
involving fractional share quantities in over-the-counter settings can be accurately reported 
within the OTC Reporting Facility. 

In addition to these rule amendments, we encourage FINRA to work closely with reporting facility 
operators to ensure that technical adjustments are made in the systems supporting these facilities to 
handle fractional share quantities seamlessly and without disruption. This modernization would enhance 
transparency in fractional share trading, ensuring equal regulatory treatment of fractional and whole 
share trading activities. These updates would ensure FINRA rules reflect the evolution of market 
practices and the widespread adoption of fractional shares as a standard offering by modern brokerage 
platforms. FINRA can further its mission to protect investors and uphold market integrity while fostering 
innovation and inclusivity in capital markets. 

Fingerprinting 

We encourage FINRA to collaborate with the Securities and Exchange Commission to modernize 
fingerprinting requirements of securities industry personnel under 17 CFR § 240.17f-2. Specifically, there 
are underlying interpretive questions regarding who is in scope for fingerprinting due to the unclear 
definition of “Associated Person.” Additionally, non-U.S. persons who have not lived in or spent 
meaningful time in the U.S. are unlikely to have a U.S. criminal history, and fingerprinting non-U.S. 
persons creates operational burdens for member firms and these individuals and introduces conflicts 
with foreign laws, especially those governing privacy.

Re: Regulatory Notice 25-04 on a Broad Review of FINRA’s Regulatory Requirements 

Dear Mr. Shaikun and Ms. Seidel, 

The American Securities Association1 appreciates the opportunity to provide comments on 
FINRA’s initiative to modernize its regulatory framework2 for member firms and associated 
persons. As a stakeholder committed to fostering investor protection and market integrity, we 
support FINRA’s focus on adapting to the evolving technological and operational landscape. 

In light of this modernization effort, we would like to highlight several areas for consideration 
that could enhance the effectiveness of FINRA's regulatory approach while addressing 
challenges faced by member firms. 

Cybersecurity Roundtable 
We appreciate FINRA’s recent announcement establishing the Financial Intelligence Fusion 
Center, which is an important initiative to bring firms together for real time threat management. 
We recommend that FINRA consider ways to encourage firm participation in the Financial

competitively balanced capital markets. This mission advances financial independence, stimulates job creation, and increases 
prosperity. ASA has a geographically diverse membership base that spans the Heartland, Southwest, Southeast, Atlantic, and 
Pacific Northwest regions of the United States.

Intelligence Fusion Center, including convening an open roundtable specifically focused on the 
initiative’s goals and structure.  

Additionally, FINRA should consider regional forums focused on cybersecurity. Such forums 
would enable firms—especially those who are open about cyberattacks and vulnerabilities—to 
share information, learn from each other, and receive recognition for transparency, rather than 
facing additional punitive measures for reporting incidents. Private companies victimized by 
cybercriminals are too often treated by government agencies as the perpetrator which undermines 
the ability of the private sector and government to work together to address cyberthreats.  

This approach would be particularly beneficial for regional firms who often lack the extensive 
resources of larger Wall Street institutions and may be more susceptible to sophisticated cyber 
threats. The roundtable should also address the rapid evolution of threats driven by AI and voice 
recognition technologies and facilitate the sharing of best practices and recommendations across 
the industry. By creating a collaborative environment where firms are encouraged to report 
incidents and share lessons learned, FINRA can help elevate the overall cybersecurity posture of 
the industry—especially for smaller and regional firms—and ensure a more resilient and secure 
financial system.  

Off-Channel Communications Roundtable 
We recommend that FINRA convene a roundtable on off-channel communications to explore 
practical solutions for managing communications outside traditional platforms with a safe harbor 
that reassures firms that they can participate in an open dialogue without fear of referrals to 
exams or enforcement. This discussion should include the development of a clear definition of 
""business as such"" to provide firms with greater clarity on what constitutes regulated 
communications.  

Text Messaging as an Important Communication Channel 
It is essential to recognize that texting has become the primary method of communication for 
many individuals, including clients and families not connected to the financial industry. People 
text and will not stop; this is a widespread societal trend that is unlikely to reverse. As such, 
regulators must address the realities of how people communicate today. Simply disallowing 
texting as a communication channel is not a practical or effective solution. 

We suggest that, from a private client standpoint, the requirements for regulatory capture of text 
messages should be narrowed to communications that directly involve trades or customer 
accounts. For institutional capital markets clients, and trading desks, only texts that pertain to 
clients, trades, or the color of the market should be subject to capture requirements. This 
approach would allow for effective oversight without imposing unnecessary burdens on member 
firms or infringing on personal communications. 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Gifts and Gratuities 
To promote regulatory consistency and reduce unnecessary complexity for firms registered as 
both broker-dealers and investment advisers, we recognize FINRA’s recent filing with the SEC 
proposing to increase its annual limit on gifts and gratuities from the longstanding $100 cap to 
$250 per person, per year and codify various guidance issued related to the rule which will allow 
for uniform application across the industry. This proposed amendment represents a significant 
step toward modernizing the rule. 

By raising the FINRA limit to $250, the proposed change would help alleviate some of the 
operational burdens faced by dual registrants who must currently navigate differing standards. 
The change would also provide greater clarity and fairness across the industry, making 
compliance easier and more transparent. We believe this adjustment strikes a more appropriate 
balance between effective oversight and practical administration, supporting both investor 
protection and the operational efficiency of member firms. We encourage continued efforts to 
further harmonize these standards in the future. 

Pay to Play  
We would like to suggest that FINRA consider whether there is room to provide greater 
flexibility under the current pay-to-play rules. Specifically, we recommend exploring whether the 
existing exemptions could be expanded, particularly with respect to the amount of permissible 
contributions. This flexibility could also benefit firms when hiring an advisor who has made a 
political contribution within the two-year “cooling off” period. In particular, we are interested in 
exploring whether the scope of existing exemptions might be broadened, including a possible 
reassessment of the thresholds for permissible contributions and possible exemption if an 
inadvertent violation is promptly remediated. 

Increasing the exempted amount—such as raising the current thresholds for de minimis 
contributions—could help firms more effectively recruit and retain talent without compromising 
the rule’s intent to prevent undue influence. At a minimum, we encourage FINRA to engage with 
industry stakeholders to discuss whether adjustments to these thresholds or other aspects of the 
rule are warranted in light of evolving market practices and the practical realities of political 
engagement. 

We recognize the importance of maintaining the rule’s core objective of preventing undue 
influence, and we believe there may be ways to balance this goal with practical considerations 
around talent recruitment and retention. For example, increasing the de minimis contribution 
limits could offer firms more flexibility while upholding the rule’s intent. 

We encourage FINRA to engage in dialogue with industry stakeholders and other interested 
parties to assess whether adjustments to these thresholds or other aspects of the rule may be 
appropriate in light of evolving market practices and the realities of political engagement. We 

 
 
 
 
 
 
welcome the opportunity to participate in such discussions and to consider a range of 
perspectives on this important issue. 

Form 5123 for Private Placements 
In addition, we urge FINRA to consider broadening the exemptions from Form 5123 filing 
requirements for private placements, especially for offerings involving accredited investors (AIs) 
who are natural persons. Given the increasing sophistication of individual accredited investors 
and recent regulatory developments—including the SEC’s March 2025 no-action relief obtained 
by Latham & Watkins, which allows issuers to rely on investor representations for accreditation 
under Rule 506(c)—there may be opportunities to streamline compliance burdens without 
diminishing investor protections. Expanding these exemptions would be consistent with the 
SEC’s approach and could reduce unnecessary administrative burdens on member firms. 

Alignment of SEC and FINRA Marketing Rules 
While we recognize that progress has been made toward aligning SEC and FINRA marketing 
rules, we believe continued dialogue between FINRA and the SEC is important to ensure that 
regulatory requirements remain consistent and do not create unnecessary complexity for dually 
registered firms. We support ongoing efforts to harmonize these frameworks and encourage 
FINRA to work collaboratively with the SEC to further reduce regulatory overlap and confusion.   

One area, among others, where regulatory alignment can be achieved relates to the ability of 
member firms to project performance or targeted returns in communications with qualified 
purchasers and other certain investors where specific conditions are met.  In this regard, FINRA 
proposed changes to Rule 2210, recognizing that such changes were in many ways consistent 
with the SEC’s Marketing Rule.  We would encourage FINRA to continue to advocate for the 
completion of such review and the adoption of its proposed rule.    

Electronic Delivery 
We urge FINRA to engage in discussions with the SEC to support making electronic delivery (e-
delivery) the default method for investor communications. While we recognize that the SEC has 
primary jurisdiction over disclosure delivery requirements, a coordinated approach between 
FINRA and the SEC would help modernize the regulatory framework, reduce administrative 
burdens, and better align with investor preferences and technological advancements. Default e-
delivery-with appropriate safeguards and opt-out provisions for those who prefer paper-would 
enhance efficiency, reduce costs, and support environmental sustainability, as demonstrated by 
recent legislative proposals and broad industry support. We encourage FINRA to work closely 
with the SEC to facilitate this transition and ensure a seamless experience for both firms and 
investors. We further encourage FINRA to review rule requiring document delivery to identify 
areas where the volume of paper or frequency of delivery can be reduced in order to streamline 
communications with investors.  

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Onboarding of Associated Persons 
We believe that FINRA rules relating to the onboarding of associated persons, particularly those 
who are working overseas, should be reviewed and streamlined to remove onerous and 
unnecessary burdens on member firms. In particular, the FINRA Fingerprint Program and related 
FBI requirements prohibit electronic fingerprinting collection outside of the U.S. FINRA does 
not have a designated vendor outside of the U.S., which leads firms to send employees to various 
locations with physical cards. This is extremely inefficient and raises several risks related to the 
transporting of physical fingerprinting cards internationally. FINRA should consider designating 
an offshore vendor and revisit the definition of “associated person” to provide additional 
flexibility for using workers in international locations to perform administrative and operational 
functions.  

Align with SEC Rules for Payments of Commissions  
Many registered representatives of independent broker-dealers operate as independent 
contractors and small business owners, using a pass-through entity to operate their businesses. 
FINRA rules prohibit broker-dealers from paying commissions directly to an entity, but the SEC 
allows for advisory fees to be paid directly to an entity. This creates operational complexities for 
both the broker-dealer and the independent financial professional, who can see fees paid to an 
entity and commissions to the individual, who then must direct those monies to the entity to pay 
business expenses. FINRA should align with the SEC and allow commissions fees to be paid to 
entities controlled by a registered representative.  

Enforcement  
We urge FINRA to reassess the alignment between the priorities of its senior leadership and 
those of its enforcement division, as firms continue to find it challenging to thread the needle 
between robust compliance efforts and the realities of regulatory enforcement. Many firms are 
diligently writing policies, setting standards, and implementing centralized supervision across 
business units to ensure compliance. These policies are designed with the expectation that 
supervisors will act on them, yet even with these efforts, a disconnect persists between the 
regulatory framework outlined by FINRA and the manner in which its enforcement staff interacts 
with member firms. 

This disconnect is particularly acute in areas such as cybersecurity, where firms that have 
implemented measures consistent with regulatory guidance may still face enforcement actions 
from both FINRA and the SEC following cyberattacks by foreign actors. Such investigations 
create unnecessary burdens for firms that are already victims of external threats and risk 
discouraging proactive compliance efforts. 

We believe that navigating this complex environment requires better education—not only for 
member firms but also within FINRA itself. We urge FINRA to improve the training and 
education of its examination teams and rule writers to ensure there is no disconnect between the 
intent of the rules and their enforcement. Consider also that recent SEC statements have made 

 
 
 
 
 
clear that their staff will not undertake broad enforcement sweeps without clear evidence of 
violations, suggesting a more measured approach that FINRA could emulate. 

Moreover, we recommend that non-enforcement senior individuals at FINRA become more 
engaged in the process. Their involvement would allow for a deeper understanding of firm 
practices and facilitate adjustments when enforcement may not be the best tool—particularly in 
cases where there is no meaningful harm to clients and no indication of willful rule violations. 
Enforcement should be reserved as a last resort for clear and significant breaches, rather than 
being the default response to every compliance challenge. In many cases, education, guidance, 
and collaborative problem-solving will be more effective in achieving FINRA’s mission of 
investor protection and market integrity. 

Conclusion  
We appreciate FINRA’s willingness to engage with stakeholders on these important issues and 
look forward to further dialogue on modernizing the regulatory framework to reflect current 
communication practices and technological realities.

Re:  

FINRA Regulatory Notice 25-04 

Dear Ms. Mitchell: 

We appreciate the opportunity to comment on FINRA’s review of its rules and guidance. We 
strongly support FINRA’s efforts to assess and modernize its rules.  

Capital Client Group, Inc., a registered broker-dealer, is part of The Capital Group Companies, 
Inc., one of the oldest and largest privately held investment management organizations in the 
United States with more than 90 years of investment experience. Through our investment adviser 
affiliates, we actively manage equity and fixed income investments across all market sectors in 
various collective investment vehicles and institutional client separate accounts. The vast majority 
of these assets consist of the American Funds family of mutual funds as well as other U.S. regulated 
investment companies for which Capital Client Group serves as principal underwriter and 
distributor. 

Align FINRA Rule 2210 with the SEC Marketing Rule 

We support the comments by the Investment Company Institute related to FINRA’s review of its 
rules.1 In our role as distributor of Capital Group managed funds and strategies, we have extensive 
experience with FINRA and SEC advertising rules. One of the challenges we have experienced 
over time is the difference between FINRA Rule 2210 and SEC advertising rules. This challenge has 
become more acute with the implementation of the SEC’s Marketing Rule2 and the industry’s shift 
from brokerage to advisory relationships. Today, many of our distribution partners are dually 
registered, and thus our advertising material may be used in both brokerage and advisory 
relationships. Having inconsistent and conflicting standards has caused us to either use the more 
restrictive standard (generally FINRA) or create different versions of the same content. Applying

2 Rule 206(4)-1 under the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 (“Marketing Rule”). 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
the restrictive standard deprives financial advisors and their clients of information that can help 
them make better investment decisions. Creating different versions of the same material results in 
inefficiencies and additional expense. We believe harmonizing Rule 2210 and related guidance 
with the Marketing Rule could solve these challenges. Specifically, FINRA should permit related 
performance information to be used with retail investors, as permitted by the Marketing Rule. 
Related performance can be helpful to existing and prospective investors in understanding a firm’s 
investment process and results for similar strategies. For example, we have received requests from 
retirement plan fiduciaries to review the performance of related accounts, and in some cases 
provide it to plan participants, because they feel it is relevant to an investment decision.     

Permit targeted returns 

FINRA should revisit its proposal that would permit performance projections and targeted returns 
to be included in sales material.3 We believe that targeted returns can be valuable for both 
institutional and retail investors to understand intended outcomes and the volatility and risks 
associated with an investment strategy. Furthermore, this information can help investors better 
assess how a particular strategy can fit within a broader portfolio. Institutional investors often 
request information on performance targets for these reasons. We also believe it is important for 
investors to understand the limitations of the information and the risks associated with the 
investment. The general requirement of Rule 2210 that communications be fair, balanced, not 
misleading and provide a sound basis to evaluate claims, helps provide the appropriate investor 
protections for illustrations with targeted returns. Furthermore, we believe that targeted returns of 
an investment strategy are similar in nature to price targets in research reports, which are currently 
permitted under 2210.4 In both cases, the target is an estimate based on a range of possible 
outcomes.  

Improve the 2210 filing process 

We also support changes to the process for filing member communications under Rule 2210. 
While we have had a positive experience with the FINRA review process, we believe there are 
some areas that could be improved. As the ICI notes in its letter, it is common industry practice to 
re-file communications to address comments and receive a “clean” letter from FINRA. FINRA 
should clarify its rules to permit the use of material if another member has received a clean letter or 
attests that they have addressed any comments provided by FINRA staff on the prior filing. We also 
suggest that materials resubmitted to address FINRA comments be subject to a reduced filing fee. 
In our experience filings that are resubmitted generally have few changes that are less 
burdensome to review than the full content in the initial submission. 

Revise the requirement to display member firm name in all communications with the public 

The requirement to include the name of the FINRA firm publishing the communication should be 
revisited for certain types of material. Including the member firm name on signage and non-
clickable web or mobile pages can be impractical. If the material includes the firm’s logo or the 
name of a product offered by the firm, we do not believe adding the name of the broker dealer 
offering the product is helpful to investors. The brand name and/or logo of the firm or product

the firm and the investment strategy.    

Update Rule 5130  

FINRA should consider changes to Rule 5130 to clarify that (1) collective investment trusts (“CITs”) 
established under section 3(c)(11) of the Investment Company Act of 1940 and (2) investment 
companies organized under the laws of a jurisdiction outside of the United States are exempt from 
the Rule’s requirements. Rule 5130 restricts the sale of initial equity public offerings (“IPOs”) to 
certain restricted persons including FINRA members and broker-dealer personnel. The rule 
exempts purchases by certain types of pooled accounts in which a member may have a beneficial 
interest, including certain common trust funds and registered investment companies established 
under the 1940 Act (“RICs”).  

In recent years many retirement plans have shifted from investments in RICs to CITs. This has 
resulted in our affiliated investment advisers managing more assets in these vehicles. When our 
affiliated advisers invest in an IPO, they allocate shares among the various vehicles they manage, 
including CITs. The investment banks offering IPO shares to the advisers often require 
representations that the advisers will not allocate shares to a restricted person or an account where 
a restricted person is a beneficial owner as defined by Rule 5130. This poses challenges since a 
retirement plan sponsored by a FINRA member firm or a broker-dealer employee could hold 
shares of a CIT managed by our affiliated advisers which may invest in IPO shares. We experience 
similar challenges when allocating IPO shares to investment companies established outside the 
U.S. 

Accordingly, we believe Rule 5130 should be revised to exempt CITs and non-U.S. investment 
companies. Both types of funds should be treated the same as RICs because they are pooled 
vehicles with diverse holdings and multiple beneficial owners. Exposure to an IPO through a 
broadly diversified fund that is also subject to fiduciary duties and oversight obligations, and for 
CITs, prohibited transaction rules under the Employee Retirement Security Act of 1974, does not 
raise the conflicts 5130 was designed to address (allocating IPO holdings to a member’s own 
associated persons at the expense of clients). We believe it is important for funds managed by our 
affiliated advisers to have exposure to IPO investment opportunities which have the potential to 
benefit investors.

FINRA  Review  to  Modernize  Rules  Regarding  Member  Firms  and  Associated 
Persons (Regulatory Notice 25-04) 

Citadel Securities strongly supports FINRA’s initiative to review and modernize its rules in 
light of market structure evolution.1  Technology, innovation, and competition continue to reshape 
U.S. financial markets, and now is the right time to comprehensively review the current regulatory 
framework and take decisive action to remove unnecessary costs and increase efficiency to unleash 
a new wave of innovation and investment.  Our capital markets are the envy of the world, and we 
must continue to foster and embrace competition, innovation, and smart regulation.   

Below, we provide specific recommendations relating to current FINRA rules that are designed 

to improve efficiency and competition, and reduce unnecessary regulatory burdens.

I.  Modernizing Key FINRA Rules 

A.  Improving the “Riskless Principal” Definition 

FINRA trade reporting rules define a “riskless principal” transaction as a transaction in which 
a member, after having received an order to buy (sell) a security, purchases (sells) the security as 
principal  and  satisfies  the  original  order  by  selling  (buying)  as  principal  at  the  same  price 
(excluding any mark-up, mark-down, commission-equivalent, or other fee).2   

This  definition  could  be  interpreted  to  exclude  instances  where  a  member  acts  as  riskless 
principal for a customer order, but gives the customer a better price than the price the member 
obtains  on  the  market-facing  leg  (i.e.  price  improvement).    Such  an  interpretation  leads  to 
inaccurate data regarding market trading activity and order routing, and could unnecessarily limit 
price improvement opportunities for customers.  As such, FINRA should clarify that the current 
riskless  principal  definition  accommodates  customer  price  improvement  by  affirming  that  the 
relevant “mark-up” or “mark-down” on a given transaction could be negative (i.e. in the customer’s 
favor).  Alternatively, FINRA could remove the reference to “at the same price.” 

We note that FINRA should also identify other instances where a “riskless principal” definition 

appears in its ruleset and make appropriate conforming changes.  

B.  Updating the Manning Rule Following Recent SEC Rule Changes 

FINRA  Rule  5320  prohibits  member  firms  from  trading  ahead  of  customer  orders.    The 
Supplementary Material contains, among others, a limited exception that sets forth the minimum 
amount of price improvement necessary for a member to execute an order on a proprietary basis 
when holding an unexecuted limit order in that same security without being required to execute 
the held limit order.3   This minimum amount of price improvement is currently set at one penny 
for  NMS  stocks  and  customer  limit  orders  priced  greater  than  or  equal  to  $1.00,  reflecting  the 
minimum quoting increment currently set forth in Rule 612 of Regulation NMS.4   

On  September  18,  2024,  the  SEC  amended  Rule  612  by  reducing  the  minimum  quoting 
increment to $0.005 for certain NMS stocks.5  However, the rule is now being challenged in court 
and the SEC has stayed its effective date.6  To the extent this SEC rule change moves forward, 
FINRA must maintain consistency by making conforming changes to Supplementary Material .06 
to reflect the smaller quoting minimum increments in certain symbols.

C.  Removing Conflicts of Interest in Corporate Bond Offerings7 

FINRA Rule 5131 seeks to mitigate conflicts of interest in the new issuance allocation process 
by  prohibiting  underwriters  from  inappropriately  tying  or  bundling  other  services  (such  as 
secondary  market  trading)  to  investor  allocation  decisions.    Specifically,  FINRA  rules  prohibit 
underwriters  from  allocating  shares  of  a  new  issuance  “as  consideration  or  inducement  for  the 
receipt of compensation that is excessive in relation to the services provided by the member.”  8  
Nonetheless,  academic  research  suggests  that  the  amount  of  secondary  market  trading  activity 
directed  by  an  investor  to  a  specific  underwriter  can  be  an  important  factor  in  new  issuance 
allocation decisions.9   

We thus recommend that FINRA enhance Rule 5131 to specifically prohibit tying or bundling 
secondary market trading to investor allocation decisions.  Tying or bundling secondary market 
trading activity to new issuance allocations negatively impacts the U.S. corporate bond market, as 
secondary trading activity is artificially concentrated among a small group of underwriters, thus 
decreasing market competition and liquidity, and increasing transaction costs for all investors.   

II.  Coordinating With the SEC to Modernize Overlapping Rulesets 

A.  Tackling the Growth of Private Rooms on ATSs 

As  detailed  in  our  recent  White  Paper  “Enhancing  Competition  and  Innovation  in  U.S. 
Financial Markets,”10 so-called “private rooms –  where  a single firm  can  elect  to interact with 
order  flow  from  one  or  more  chosen  counterparties  to  the  exclusion  of  everyone  else  –  are 
increasingly  common  on  ATSs.    Private  rooms  raise  a  number  of  novel  concerns  that  warrant 
regulatory scrutiny, including the level of compliance with (i) the definition of an ATS, (ii) ATS 
transparency  requirements,  (iii)  execution  quality  disclosure  requirements,  (iv)  best  execution 
requirements, and (v) monitoring and surveillance responsibilities. 

FINRA has a role in evaluating compliance with many of these regulatory requirements given 
its oversight over the broker-dealer operator of an ATS.  We, therefore, recommend that FINRA 
work closely with the SEC to determine whether ATS are offering “private rooms” in a compliant 
manner  (for  example,  it  appears  that  ATSs  are  circumventing  execution  quality  disclosure 
requirements by automatically deeming all orders to be “not held” – even retail orders executed in 

7 We note this recommendation is also relevant for the related consultation on modernizing FINRA rules to facilitate 
capital formation (Regulatory Notice 25-06).

benefit from equivalent levels of execution quality transparency, regardless of where it is executed, 
and FINRA (in conjunction with the SEC) should ensure all ATSs publish Rule 605 reports. 

B.  Improving the Margin Framework for Listed Options 

Margin requirements for customers in the listed options market are set by reference to SEC, 
FINRA,  and  OCC  rules.12   Experience  has  demonstrated  that  the  current  margin  framework  is 
insufficiently risk-based.  For example, per contract minimum margin levels often appear to dictate 
overall  margin  requirements,  even  though  they  are  completely  divorced  from  the  market  risk 
associated  with  a  particular  cleared  portfolio.    In  addition,  the  OCC’s  TIMS  methodology  for 
customers can yield very different results than its separate STANS methodology that is applied to 
direct OCC members.  Finally, cross-margining between options positions cleared at the OCC and 
equities  positions  cleared  at  the  NSCC  is  currently  not  supported,  which  also  unnecessarily 
increases costs for market participants. 

We recommend that FINRA work with the OCC and the SEC to improve the customer margin 
framework  for  listed  options  by  making  it  more  risk-based  and  increasing  alignment  with  the 
STANS methodology used for direct OCC members.  In addition, FINRA should support industry 
efforts to introduce cross-margining between listed options and equities. 

C.  Critically Evaluating Intentional Delay Mechanisms 

In the equities market, top-of-book displayed and accessible quotations on each exchange are 
considered to be “protected,” meaning that market participants must route order flow to execute 
against those prices before accessing deeper liquidity.  In order for a quotation to be “protected,” 
Rule  600  of  Regulation  NMS  provides  that  it  must  be  “immediately  and  automatically” 
accessible. 13    When  adopting  Regulation  NMS,  the  Commission  clarified  that  “[t]he  term 
‘immediate’ precludes any coding of automated systems or other type of intentional device that 
would delay the action taken with respect to a quotation.”14 However, in 2016, the Commission 
opted  to  unilaterally  reinterpret  the  term  “immediate”  to  allow  for  “de  minimis”  intentional 
delays.15 

11 See, e.g., IntelligentCross ATS-N Part III, Item 7 (“All orders entered into the ATS by Subscribers are Not Held”), 
available at: https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1708826/000170882625000002/xslATS-
N_X01/primary_doc.xml.  

12 See SEC Rule 15c3-1, FINRA Rule 4210, and the OCC TIMS Methodology. 

13 17 CFR 242.600(b)(3). 

14 See Securities Exchange Act Release No. 51808 (June 9, 2005). 

15 Interpretation Regarding Automated Quotations Under Regulation NMS, 81 FR 40785 (June 23, 2016), available 
at: https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/FR-2016-06-23/pdf/2016-14876.pdf.  In doing so, the SEC rejected a 
“bright line” threshold of “one millisecond” for determining whether an intentional delay is de minimis, and instead 
set a standard: a de minimis intentional delay must be one “so short as to not frustrate the purposes of Rule 611 by 
impairing fair and efficient access to an exchange’s quotations.” 

Page 5 of 9 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Since then, several trading venues have attempted to push the boundaries of what constitutes a 
“protected”  quotation,  proposing  various  intentional  delays  –  combined  with  functionality  that 
enables displayed quotations to be cancelled during the intentional delay – that have the effect of 
advantaging  a  select  group  of  market  makers.    Asymmetric  intentional  delays  are  particularly 
nefarious, as they provide certain market participants with a “last look” option to cancel resting 
orders before execution, impairing efficient access to displayed quotes and reducing fill rates and 
increasing transaction costs for investors.  Even worse, these proposals typically seek to compel 
all investors to chase the resulting inaccessible quotes due to the “order protection rule.”   

As the SEC has evaluated these proposals, it is clear that there is not a well-defined framework 
for  determining  what  constitutes  a  “de  minimis”  intentional  delay  and  the  degree  to  which 
protected quotes can be made “conditional,” leading to arbitrary decision making.  The latest filing 
under consideration involves a FINRA-endorsed proposal to grant “protected” quote status to an 
ATS for the first time, even though it includes a deeply problematic intentional delay specifically 
designed to benefit the ATS’s select cadre of market makers.16  Intentional delays are also being 
newly proposed for the listed options market. 

In  light  of  these  market  developments,  we  recommend  that  FINRA  work  with  the  SEC  to 
provide  greater  clarity  and  consistency  in  this  area.    This  includes  reverting  to  the  “protected” 
quote  definition  set  forth  in  Regulation  NMS  in  2005,  and  ensuring  that  any  revisions  to  that 
definition are effected through the standard rulemaking process.  While trading venue innovation 
should be applauded, to the extent that market participants are affirmatively compelled to access 
certain venues due to regulatory fiat – e.g. “protected” quote status – it is critical that consistent 
standards be applied and that investors are not required to chase inaccessible quotes. 

III.  Enhancing Public Reporting Regimes Administered by FINRA 

A.  Aligning the TRF and SIP Hours of Operation 

Several exchanges have recently filed to support overnight trading of equities.  SEC approval 
has  been  conditioned  on  the  SIPs  being  able  to  “collect,  consolidate,  process  and  disseminate 
consolidated data” during the overnight session.17  However, the expansion of overnight trading 
should  also  be  conditioned  on  FINRA  extending  the  TRF  hours  of  operation  in  an  equivalent 
manner.18  It is anticipated that off-exchange venues will be a significant source of liquidity during 
the overnight session, and a failure to provide real-time transparency in this segment of the market 
will complicate compliance with key regulatory requirements, such as best execution, and could 
lead to information asymmetries that exacerbate market volatility.  

16 See, e.g., Citadel Securities Statement in Opposition (Oct. 29, 2023), available at: 
https://www.sec.gov/comments/sr-finra-2022-032/srfinra2022032-286679-699882.pdf.  The associated comment 
file demonstrates widespread opposition to this proposal.

B.  Enhancing TRACE Reporting – Corporate Bonds 

The TRACE reporting framework for corporate bonds has become a gold standard globally 
across asset classes, with academic research overwhelmingly confirming the benefits for investors 
and the overall market.  However, additional steps can be taken to further enhance the quality of 
information publicly disclosed to investors. 

First, FINRA should amend its rules to allow members to identify to FINRA riskless principal 
transactions involving affiliated member firms, which will enable FINRA to suppress the public 
dissemination of the inter-affiliate leg of these trades.  The public reporting of both legs of these 
riskless principal transactions results in duplicative information that is not useful to investors for 
pricing, valuation or risk purposes.  FINRA rules already allow members to identify and suppress 
the public dissemination of riskless principal transactions involving non-member affiliates, and 
this  practice  should  be  extended  to  riskless  principal  transactions  involving  affiliates  that  are 
FINRA members. 

Second, we recommend that FINRA work with the SEC to improve the transparency of block 
trades.  Under current rules, TRACE does not immediately disclose the notional size of corporate 
bond transactions that exceed the block trade threshold, which is $5 million for investment grade 
bonds and $1 million for high yield bonds.  Data shows that more than 50% of notional traded in 
investment grade bonds and as much as 85% of notional traded in high yield bonds now qualifies 
as a block trade.19  The actual notional size of these transactions is then publicly disclosed on a 
quarterly basis no earlier than 6 months after the transaction date.20   FINRA should reduce the 
timeline for publishing full notional sizes, as the current 6 month timeline hampers best execution 
analyses by investors and creates an unlevel playing field with respect to access to information.  
FINRA should also raise the block trade thresholds to better reflect current market dynamics, as 
they have not been updated since TRACE was first implemented in the early 2000s.  In other asset 
classes,  regulators  have  sought  to  ensure  that  no  more  than  33%  of  total  notional  traded  in  a 
particular instrument is eligible for block trade treatment.21  This approach is designed to provide 
market participants with a timely view of a large-enough portion of transaction and pricing data to 
conduct  meaningful  best  execution  analysis,  while  still  permitting  truly  large  transactions  to 
qualify for block trade status.   

C.  Enhancing TRACE Reporting – U.S. Treasuries 

The U.S. Treasury market remains an outlier with respect to post-trade transparency in that it 
has only recently implemented end-of-day public dissemination for transactions in the limited set 
of on-the-run securities.22  In the dealer-to-customer segment of the market for nominal coupons, 

19 See, e.g., Fixed Income Market Structure Advisory Committee, April 9, 2018, available at: 
https://www.sec.gov/spotlight/fixed-income-advisory-committee/fimsac-block-trade-recommendation.pdf.  

20 https://www.finra.org/filing-reporting/trace/historic-academic-data.  

21 See Procedures To Establish Appropriate Minimum Block Sizes for Large Notional Off-Facility Swaps and Block 
Trades, 77 FR 15460 (May 31, 2013), available at: https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/FR-2013-05-31/pdf/2013-
12133.pdf.  

22 88 FR 77388 (Nov. 9, 2023). 

Page 7 of 9 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
where investors would benefit from far greater transparency, more than 50% of all transactions 
and more than 30% of total notional traded are in off-the-run Treasuries, which are completely 
excluded from current public dissemination requirements for individual transactions.23  We urge 
FINRA to work with other policymakers to improve U.S. Treasury market functioning by more 
closely replicating the post-trade transparency framework for corporate bonds.  This includes (i) 
significantly reducing the current end-of-day public dissemination timeframe for transactions in 
on-the-run securities and (ii) expanding reporting requirements to off-the-run Treasury securities. 

D.  Introducing Post-Trade Transparency for OTC Options 

FINRA’s  expertise  in  administering  public  reporting  regimes  across  asset  classes  makes  it 
well-suited  to  work  with  the  SEC  to  implement  post-trade  transparency  for  over-the-counter 
options.  Currently, the OTC options market is opaque, and market participants (not only in OTC 
options but also in correlated markets) would meaningfully benefit from the introduction of timely 
public reporting of transaction-level data (including price, size, and execution time). 

IV.  Increasing Regulatory Efficiency 

A.  Rationalizing Market Surveillance in Equities and Options 

(i)  The Consolidated Audit Trail  

As  detailed  in  our  recent  White  Paper  “Enhancing  Competition  and  Innovation  in  U.S. 
Financial  Markets,”  the  Consolidated  Audit  Trail  (“CAT”)  is  not  operating  on  firm  footing, 
plagued  by  wasteful  spending,  ineffective  governance,  and  a  plethora  of  data  privacy  and 
cybersecurity concerns.  We urge FINRA to work with the SEC and the other SROs to improve 
the  operation  and  oversight  of  the  CAT  while  maintaining  robust  market  surveillance.    Key 
objectives include (a) dramatically reducing the operational costs of the CAT and (b) requiring the 
operational costs of the CAT to be included in the SEC’s budget in order to ensure appropriate 
oversight and alignment of incentives. 

(ii)  Electronic Blue Sheets 

When  the  SEC  directed  the  SROs  to  submit  a  plan  to  create  the  CAT,  the  SEC  expressly 
contemplated  that  the  CAT would  result in the retirement of the parallel  electronic  blue  sheets 
system (“EBS”).24  Yet even though the CAT is now fully operational, the EBS system has not 
been retired.  This results in market participants incurring duplicative costs for market surveillance 
and FINRA should work with the SEC to rectify this situation.    

23 See https://www.finra.org/finra-data/browse-catalog/about-treasury/monthly-file.

(iii) Options Regulatory Fee 

In the listed options market, each exchange assesses its own “options regulatory fee” on market 
participants.  We encourage FINRA to work with the options exchanges to explore how to better 
streamline cross-market surveillance and reduce associated costs given FINRA’s expertise in this 
area.   

B.  Improving the Fairness of the Trading Activity Fee 

FINRA assesses a trading activity fee (“TAF”) to help recover the costs of supervising member 
firms.    At  the  moment,  the  TAF  is  assessed  against  transactions  in  equities,  options,  security 
futures, and bonds.25  We recommend that FINRA consider expanding this list to include other 
asset classes covered by FINRA rules, including security-based swaps and digital assets that are 
securities.

Regulatory Notice 25-04,GVC Capital Comment On Regulatory Notice 25-04,2025-06-12,"Comments by GVC Capital LLC regarding FINRA Regulatory Notice 25-04 
(“Rule Modernization”) (Submitted June 11, 2025) 

Introduction: 

FINRA small ﬁrm member GVC Capital LLC (“GVC”) appreciates the opportunity to 
comment in response to this Regulatory Notice and respectfully submits the following 
comments and speciﬁc proposals for improvements. 

The broad scope of Regulatory Notice 25-04 invites sweeping responses by all FINRA 
member ﬁrms.  GVC’s limited resources as a small broker dealer ﬁrm do not permit such a 
sweeping response by GVC.  Reserving its rights to make additional or revised comments 
and proposals in the future, GVC will focus in this comment document only on three 
important areas adversely impacting GVC and other member ﬁrms that urgently require 
FINRA’s attention, improvements and the speciﬁc reforms described herein. 

GVC’s comments and speciﬁc easily actionable proposals/suggestions for improvements 
herein would not harm investor protection or market integrity.   

GVC endeavors herein to be responsive to FINRA’s request for member feedback in scope 
from “speciﬁc rules to broad thematic groups of requirements.” FINRA Regulatory Notice 
25-04, page 4 and footnote 5.   Also, GVC appreciates FINRA’s welcoming of “comment on 
where FINRA’s oversight of its member ﬁrms interacts with other non-FINRA regulatory 
requirements such that it should be a focus for this [FINRA] review.”  Id. page 4. 

FINRA stated: “For example, there may be areas where FINRA should consider whether its 
rules create unintended confusion, impose unnecessary or duplicative burdens, or are 
insuUiciently tailored to the broader regulatory and business environment of its member 
ﬁrms.”  Id. (underlining and yellow highlighting emphasis added). 

FINRA stated also: “Comments are welcome regardless of whether the requirements are 
related to or derived from a statutory or other non-FINRA source.”  Id. at footnote 5.  This is 
important especially in respect of the SEC’s requirements on FINRA member ﬁrms. 

Although GVC personnel have endeavored to research thoroughly the matters discussed 
herein, GVC acknowledges its personnel may have missed materials and/or references that 

 
 
may be important and relevant.  GVC also acknowledges the diUiculty of drafting rules, 
including inter alia the “ripple eUects” of amending complex and/or interrelated rules.  GVC 
stands open, ready, willing and able to consider any such other materials and/or 
references.  And we with GVC would be happy to discuss these matters with FINRA 
personnel. 

Three Big Problems (Pain Points for FINRA Member Firms) that Require FINRA’s Urgent 
Attention: 

Discussed in more detail below, these are: 

1.  Drastically Improve and Reform FINRA Arbitration 
2.  Improve and Reform FINRA Rule 2210 (“Communications with the Public”) and 

Related Guidance; Amend, Harmonize and Coordinate Deﬁnitions of “Institutional 
Investor” 

3.  Work with the SEC to Repeal in its Entirety Regulation Best Interest (“Reg BI”) and 
Instead Enforce and Interpret Mutatis Mutandis FINRA Rule 2111 Suitability and 
Related Laws, Rules and Regulations in Place Before Reg BI 

1.  Drastically Improve and Reform FINRA Arbitration: 

For several years and at various times, GVC personnel have attempted in good faith to “go 
through/use proper FINRA channels” to explain the overarching fundamental defects and 
unfairness of current FINRA arbitration and to propose speciﬁc, easily implementable ﬁxes.   

These “proper FINRA channels” pursued by GVC included inter alia GVC’s speciﬁc oral and 
written outreach to FINRA attorneys whom we were advised are responsible for these 
matters (FINRA attorneys Todd Salzman and Victoria Crane); the FINRA Small Firm Advisory 
Committee (via its member Mr. Bob Hammon); and FINRA’s former Small Firm Member of 
the FINRA Board of Governors Ms. Page Pierce.  GVC’s Kent Lund, a current member of 
FINRA’s West Region Committee, also endeavored use that resource in these regards. 

GVC also raised these issues and speciﬁc proposals with FINRA’s OUice of the Ombuds, 
speciﬁcally via communications with Ombuds and Vice President Sarah Gill and Associate 
Director Christopher Cook. 

GVC’s speciﬁc analysis and requests for improvements are discussed, explained, 
researched and supported in detail in the attached PDF of a July 26, 2021, twenty-three-
page Memorandum and Formal Written Request that GVC’s Kent Lund sent to FINRA 
attorneys Todd Salzman and Victoria Crane. 

2 

 
 
These extensive and proactive eLorts went nowhere/bore no fruit.  GVC received NO 
substantive responses and/or rebuttals to our July 26, 2021, Memorandum and we were 
told nothing would be done.  We asked for any additional relevant materials and/or 
references that we may have missed.  We received none from FINRA. 

As detailed and explained in our July 26, 2021, Memorandum to FINRA, our speciﬁc 
proposed, fully researched and supported ﬁxes can be summarized as follows: 

As detailed our July 26, 2021, formal written request to FINRA, it is critical that 
FINRA implement especially the following three overarching speciﬁc urgent actions 
in and for its Arbitration Regime: 

1.     Mandate that FINRA’s six-year arbitration eligibility rule is a statute of 

repose and not a statute of limitations. As such, all securities transactions 
and/or other allegedly wrongful events or conduct that took place/occurred prior 
to six years from the ﬁling of a FINRA arbitration claim are not eligible for FINRA 
arbitration. Period, end of story.  

2.     Mandate in the FINRA arbitrators’ oath that each FINRA arbitrator is 

required to: (a) ascertain fairly all relevant facts of the dispute; and (b) ascertain 
and apply fairly to those relevant facts of the dispute all applicable FINRA 
Arbitration and other Rules and all applicable laws, rules, and regulations. Make 
crystal clear that FINRA arbitrators are not permitted to: fail to consider and/or 
disregard the applicable facts and/or law; operate in a vacuum untethered to the 
applicable facts and law; and/or simply do what they think is “equitable.” Delete 
all FINRA arbitration materials and staU guidance that state or imply, directly or 
indirectly, that FINRA arbitrators are permitted to render awards that they think 
are “equitable” and/or that are untethered to the applicable facts and law of the 
case. 

3.      Explained Written Decisions must be Mandatory in and for All FINRA 

Arbitration Cases, including discussion in a reasonable manner the factual and 
legal basis/rationale for the award. This means including, inter alia: (a) citations 
to applicable legal authorities explaining and/or supporting the award; and (b) 
itemized damage calculations (as applicable) warranted by and supported by 
the applicable facts and law.  The explained written decisions need not be overly 
lengthy or “legalistic”.  Awards that merely state, e.g., Party A wins and Party B 
loses, Party B pays Party A X U.S. Dollars are per se unfair and deny due process 
to the parties. Mandating reasonably detailed explained written decisions in 
every FINRA Arbitration case forces the arbitrators to properly engage in careful 
deliberations based on the applicable facts and law of each case (instead of 
pulling out of the air what they think is “equitable”) and reduces the chances of 
arbitrary, baseless and/or thoughtless decision-making. 

3 

 
  
  
  
 
Our July 26, 2021, formal written request to FINRA details how eLecting these actions 
are simple and straightforward ﬁxes, easily implementable by FINRA, and are based 
on and supported fully by applicable law, history, equity, and common sense.  

All FINRA member ﬁrms of any size, especially small ﬁrms, are vulnerable to unfair FINRA 
arbitration awards untethered to the facts and the law of the case that literally can put 
them out of business.  At present, it is not commercially or legally reasonable for any FINRA 
member ﬁrm to subject itself to FINRA Arbitration. 

2.  Improve and Reform FINRA Rule 2210 (Communications with the Public” and 

Related Guidance; Amend, Harmonize and Coordinate Deﬁnitions of 
“Institutional Investor”: 

At least two speciﬁc improvements and reforms are needed: 

First, delete the following sentence at the end of FINRA Rule 2210(a)(4): 

No member may treat a communication as having been distributed to an 
institutional investor if the member has reason to believe that the communication or 
any excerpt thereof will be forwarded or made available to any retail investor. 

Most FINRA member communications today are made via email that the intended recipient 
easily may - without any control of and/or inﬂuence by the FINRA member ﬁrm - “forward” 
or “make available” to others.  The above sentence guts the ability of a FINRA member to 
send an “institutional communication” to an “institutional investor” and thus rely on 
FINRA’s principles and rules in these regards. 

Second, amend, harmonize and make consistent all FINRA deﬁnitions of and relating to 
“institutional investor” in FINRA Rules 2210 and 4512, and otherwise. 

For example, FINRA should revise the deﬁnition of “institutional investor” in FINRA Rule 
2210(a)(4)(A) to read: 

(A) person or entity described in Rule 4512(c) or FINRA Rule 5123(b), regardless of 
whether the person or entity has an account with a member; 

FINRA Rule 4512(c) currently provides: 

(c) For purposes of this Rule, the term ""institutional account"" shall mean the 
account of: 

(1) a bank, savings and loan association, insurance company or registered 

investment company; 

4 

 
 
 
(2) an investment adviser registered either with the SEC under Section 203 of 
the Investment Advisers Act or with a state securities commission (or any agency or 
oUice performing like functions); or 

(3) any other person (whether a natural person, corporation, partnership, 

trust or otherwise) with total assets of at least $50 million. 

With total assets “of at least $50 million” is too high a minimum threshold to be considered 
an “institutional investor” and should be reduced to “with total assets of at least $5 
million.”  In support, see, e.g., FINRA Regulatory Notice 24-17 (“Capital Formation”) 
(December 20, 2024).  

In relevant part, FINRA Regulatory Notice 24-17 (page 8) proposed amendments to FINRA 
Rule 5123 to expand that rule’s ﬁling exemptions to add persons and entities included in 
the SEC’s August 2020 amendments to the deﬁnition of “accredited investor” under SEC 
Rule 501 “to more eUectively identify institutional and individual investors that have the 
knowledge and expertise to participate in private capital markets….:” 

FINRA stated (page 8, yellow highlighting emphasis added): 

The investors described above under Rule 501(a)(9) and (12) possess a level of 
sophistication and expertise that is similar to the institutional accredited investors 
currently exempted under Rule 5123 and generally do not need the additional 
protections and oversight provided through the ﬁling requirements. 

FINRA concluded (page 8, yellow highlighting emphasis added): 

The proposal amends Rule 5123 to expand its exemptions consistent with the SEC’s 
treatment of the accredited investor deﬁnition. Adding these two types of entities to 
the existing exemption establishes consistency and is appropriate for the purpose of 
Rule 5123. 

FINRA reasoned (page 8) that “natural persons or companies that own not less than 
$5,000,000 in investments … [have a] ﬁnancial threshold, which indicates an equivalently 
high level of sophistication [and expertise] to justify an exemption from Rule 5123.” 

GVC understands that diUerent deﬁnitions of terms in various rules or contexts may have 
made some sort of sense when drafted and put into place, but inconsistent deﬁnitions of 
important terms like “accredited investor”, “retail investor” and “institutional investor” 
present material compliance and implementation challenges to FINRA member ﬁrms like 
GVC.

3.  Work with the SEC to Repeal Regulation Best Interest and Instead Enforce and 

Interpret Mutatis Mutandis FINRA Rule 2111 Suitability and Related Laws, Rules 
and Regulations that Preceded Reg BI: 

To put it mildly, we recognize this is a very big ask.  But with a new SEC in place and given 
FINRA’s stated willingness to review and improve all aspects of its self-regulatory business, 
it is worth serious consideration. 

The SEC’s Reg BI and Form CRS requirements are an enormous burden (e.g., ﬁnancial and 
time) on FINRA members and are wholly unnecessary for investor protection if FINRA Rule 
2111 (“Suitabliity”) and previously in place applicable laws, rules and regulations properly 
are implemented by FINRA members and FINRA associated persons. 

FINRA Rule 2111, along with other existing applicable laws, rules and regulations including 
the catchall FINRA Rule 2210 (“Standards of Commercial Honor and Principles of Trade”), 
fully cover the investor protection waterfront. 

Reg BI and Form CRS merely pile on.  They are confusing, duplicative, expensive, 
unnecessary and wasteful regulatory overreach.   

Conclusion: 

If FINRA truly “is committed to continuous improvement that draws on deep engagement 
with its member ﬁrms” (e.g., Regulatory Notice 25-04, page 1) it will accept and implement, 
in form and/or in substance, GVC’s proposals in this document.

Submitted electronically 

Dear Ms. Mitchell, 

The Bond Dealers of America (BDA) is pleased to comment on FINRA Regulatory Notice 25-04, “FINRA 
Launches Broad Review to Modernize Rules Regarding Member Firms and Associated Persons” (the 
Notice). BDA is the only DC-based group exclusively representing the interests of securities dealers and 
banks focused on the US fixed income markets. 

BDA welcomes the comprehensive regulatory review announced in the Notice. FINRA’s rules have far 
reaching implications for the fixed income markets and fixed income dealers. It is absolutely appropriate 
for FINRA to conduct a comprehensive review of bond market regulation with an eye towards 
modernizing and improving the efficiency of FINRA rules. We will use this opportunity to recommend 
areas of the FINRA rule book which are ripe for amendment. In the area of workplace supervision, we 
recognize that FINRA has already issued a Notice (Regulatory Notice 25-07) requesting input on 
regulations governing the “organization and operation of member workplaces.” We welcome that 
Notice as well and we will provide fulsome comments separately in response to that request which will 
focus on modernizing the way fixed income employees are supervised.  

TRACE trade reporting 

On June 10, 2025 FINRA filed with the SEC (File no. SR-FINRA-2025-08) amendments to rescind changes 
to FINRA Rule 6730 approved by the Commission in September 2024 which would have required dealers 
to report most bond trades to TRACE within one minute. Under the FINRA filing, the current 15-minute 
reporting deadline would be maintained. 

BDA fully supports FINRA’s rescission of the one-minute trade reporting amendments. We agree with 
FINRA that “it is appropriate at this time to maintain the currently effective TRACE reporting standard 
requiring members to report transactions as soon as practicable, but no later than within 15 minutes of 
the Time of Execution.” We intend to file a comment letter with the Commission where we will urge  
approval of the one-minute trade reporting amendments. 

Reporting RIA allocations 

An issue we have raised consistently with FINRA throughout the discussion of shortening trade reporting 
times is the needless requirement for a dually registered Broker-Dealer and Investment Adviser (BD/IA) 
to report to TRACE allocations of block trades to individual advisory customer accounts. This 
requirement is not in the text of Rule 6730. Rather, it is specified in FINRA’s “Frequently Asked 

 
 
 
Questions (FAQ) about the Trade Reporting and Compliance Engine (TRACE)” (FAQ 3.1.47). As a result, 
this requirement was never subject to public comment or Commission review.  

In its proposed changes to Rule 6730 related to trade reporting times, FINRA addresses this issue. Under 
newly proposed Rule 6730 Supplementary Material .08, dually registered BD/IAs could either report 
individual allocations as under current policy or, alternatively, BD/IAs could choose to report the block 
trade as a single transaction and specify in the trade report the number of IA customer accounts to 
which the trade was allocated. 

BDA believes the requirement to report individual allocations to TRACE is unjustified, and we support 
the inclusion of proposed Supplementary Material .08 as an element of Rule 6730. Allocations to 
advisory customers are not trades as that term is commonly understood. They are as they are referred 
to, allocations of large trades—which are already required to be reported to TRACE—to individual 
customers. FINRA has never stated why these allocations should be reportable. The MSRB has no such 
requirement for similar transactions in municipal securities. 

Going forward, we also urge FINRA to further amend Rule 6730 to entirely eliminate the requirement to 
report block trade allocations for dually registered BD/IAs. The requirement serves no useful purpose. In 
the meantime, we welcome this proposed change now before the Commission and we ask FINRA to 
amend the TRACE FAQ document appropriately once the new Supplementary Material .08 is fully in 
place. 

Margin requirements for certain mortgage securities 

In March 2024 the SEC approved amendments to FINRA Rule 4210 to require BDs to collect and hold 
margin from customers on certain trades in agency mortgage-backed securities (MBS), defined in the 
Rule as Covered Agency Transactions (CAT). FINRA’s amendments fail to recognize decades-long market 
conventions on the settlement of new-issue MBS and unfairly disadvantage small and mid-size BDs 
relative to their larger competitors.  

As a result of the FINRA CAT amendments, BDs are required to potentially collect margin on any agency 
MBS trade that settles in a period longer than T+1. Agency MBS are issued according to a well-defined 
process that allows time for the origination and warehousing of individual mortgage loans and assembly 
of the mortgage security. As a result, new-issue agency MBS settle according to a published schedule 
established by market participants, not T+1 like much of the rest of the capital markets. If the value of 
the customer’s position drops during the time between when they agreed to buy the MBS and when the 
trade settles perhaps weeks later by more than the established de minimis amount of $250,000, the BD 
must collect and hold margin from the customer until the trade settles. Alternatively, BDs can take a 
dollar-for-dollar capital charge in lieu of margin. The CAT amendments to Rule 4210 fail to recognize 
long-established market conventions for originating and distributing new agency MBS on a specific 
schedule.  

In addition, the amendments disadvantage mid-size size BDs. Many mid-size BDs do not themselves 
clear and settle their customers’ trades. Instead, as “correspondent” dealers, they contract for this 
service with “clearing firms,” specialized BDs that provide clearing, settlement, and related services to 
other BDs and their customers. As a result, correspondent BDs do not hold customer funds or 
securities—that is done by the clearing firm—and cannot directly collect margin at all from customers. A 

2 

 
capital charge in lieu of margin provides an alternate means of compliance, but with limited capital, a 
weak MBS market could quickly absorb much of a mid-size firm’s capital until the MBS settlement date 
potentially weeks away. The biggest Wall Street banks do not face these issues. They all “self clear,” 
meaning they can directly hold customer margin funds, and have virtually unlimited capital in case they 
need to take a capital charge in lieu of margin. It is not surprising that the idea of collecting margin on 
new-issue agency MBS first arose from the Treasury Market Practices Group, a committee of the 
country’s largest banks and investors who advise the Federal Reserve Bank of New York. 

By disadvantaging smaller BDs with respect to new-issue MBS, the CAT amendments also indirectly 
disadvantage smaller mortgage originators and their customers. Small mortgage companies, community 
banks, and credit unions depend on the ability to readily sell the mortgage loans they originate. Often 
these mortgage lenders are too small to attract the attention of large MBS dealers, but they are well 
served by mid-size dealers. By imposing unfair costs and restrictions on smaller dealers’ MBS activities, 
the CAT amendments also potentially constrain the ability of small mortgage originators to sell the loans 
they make. 

FINRA’s adoption of the CAT amendments has inspired clearing firms and large BDs to demand 
contractual margin terms from their customers and trading counterparties that are often stricter than 
the Rule requires, which has magnified the negative repercussions of the CAT amendments for mid size 
dealers even further. Moreover, even when individual customer mark-to-market losses of a 
correspondent BD may not exceed the $250,000 threshold to collect margin, the combined positions of 
all that dealer’s customer mark-to-market losses could easily exceed the threshold. That means the 
dealer’s clearing firm may be required to collect margin from their correspondent dealer in relation to 
the combined customer positions, but the dealer is not required to collect margin from their own 
individual customers.  

Another particular compliance issue with respect to the CAT amendments involves interest on customer 
margin funds. Often interest that accrues to customers on posted margin is very small, perhaps $100 or 
less. However, dealers still must calculate and pay out this interest since it represents customer funds. 
The process can be cumbersome for small amounts of interest. 

FINRA should address the shortcomings in the Rule 4210 CAT amendments by raising the de minimis 
mark-to-market trigger for collecting margin from $250,000 to $500,000 and amend the Rule such that 
CAT trades are marginable only if they settle outside the standard MBS settlement window. Also, in 
2021 FINRA published a concept release (Regulatory Notice 21-11) requesting comment on the prospect 
of requiring margin on extended settlement trades in non-mortgage products. Just as there was no 
compelling, systemic reason to require margin on CAT trades that settle within the normal MBS 
schedule, there is also no justification for requiring margin on trades in other securities that settle longer 
than T+1. We urge FINRA to act no further on that initiative. 

Additional areas for FINRA attention 

In addition to the issues outlined above and remote supervision issues raised in Regulatory Notice 25-07, 
we believe the following areas deserve attention during the rule modernization review. 

3 

 
Rule coordination with the MSRB 

Municipal securities and the municipal bond market have features which sometimes necessitate unique 
regulations that account for the idiosyncrasies of the product. However, in many areas where municipals 
do not differ significantly from other products, FINRA and MSRB rules should track very closely. While 
FINRA and the MSRB in recent years have worked diligently to coordinate their activity on new 
rulemakings such as markup disclosure and best execution, there are legacy rules where FINRA and 
MSRB regulation differ needlessly. Examples are advertising (FINRA Rule 2210 and MSRB Rule G-21), 
account transfers (FINRA Rule 11870 and MSRB Rule G-26), and supervision (FINRA Rule 3110 and MSRB 
Rule G-27). Different compliance standards for similar activities needlessly increase costs to dealers and 
raise the risk of noncompliance. We urge FINRA to include these rules in the rule modernization review. 
We will separately request the MSRB to do the same, and we ask the two SROs to coordinate these 
reviews closely with the goal of as much harmonization as possible. 

FINRA Rule 3220, the “Gift Rule.” 

FINRA Rule 3220 restricts the ability of broker-dealer employees to provide “anything of value” to 
anyone who is “in relation to the business of the employer of the recipient of the payment or gratuity” 
and establishes a limit of $100 per year for any gifts to a relevant person. We recognize the need for a 
gift rule. However, the $100 limit in the Rule was established in 1993 (NASD Notice to Members 93-8) 
and has not increased since. If the $100 gift limit had increased for inflation over the last 32 years, it 
would be approximately $225 today. 

We recognize that FINRA has filed with the SEC amendments to Rule 3220 which would raise the annual 
gift limit to $250 and make other changes to Rule 3220. BDA generally supports that initiative, and we 
plan to file comments with the Commission on this filing as appropriate. 

Additional guidance on calculations 

MSRB Rule G-33 is a technical rule governing certain calculations in determining key values related to 
rule compliance. For example, paragraph (d) of Rule G-33 provides compliance standards related to 
decimal places and truncation when calculating bond math. FINRA also has rules related to calculations. 
Rule 11620, for example, provides standards for calculating accrued interest on bond trades. However, 
FINRA rules in general do not provide sufficient detail around issues like day count and decimal places. 
We ask FINRA to address this through rulemaking or guidance particularly with respect to calculating 
accrued interest and yield to worst. 

Clarity around market movements 

Rule 2121 is FINRA’s fair pricing and markup rule. As FINRA is aware, BDs generally do not charge 
commissions on bond trades. Instead, dealers earn trading revenue from the markup or markdown of 
prices they charge or provide to customers. So markup regulation is a central element of the fixed 
income market, much more so than for exchange-traded equity transactions, for which dealers generally 
charge commissions, not markups. Bond prices and bid-ask spreads can be volatile during a trading day. 
A bond a dealer acquires in the morning may be worth more or less by the afternoon. However, BDA 
members report that FINRA examiners are often fixated on the dealer’s acquisition or disposition price 
as the indicator of prevailing market price (PMP) even when bond market benchmarks, as well as the 
PMP of the bond itself, may have moved significantly since the dealer bought or sold it. This has been a 

4 

 
particular issue for intraday price movements. We ask that FINRA provide training and guidance to 
examiners on how to determine PMP when there has been market movement between when a dealer 
acquires a bond and when they sell it. We also urge FINRA to consider whether Rule 2121 (and mark-up 
disclosure guidance) should be updated to provide additional scenarios where the PMP should reflect 
the current market price at the time of trade, given the more precise data and technology now available. 
Allowing the PMP to change only when a significant event occurs is arbitrary and may not be 
transparent. 

SEC Rule 15c2-11 

In 2021 the SEC wrongly interpreted their Rule 15c2-11, a 50+-year-old penny stock rule, to apply to 
quotations in certain fixed-income products. We do not believe the SEC’s actions were appropriate, and 
we have recently written to Chairman Atkins to request that the Commission reverse that decision. In 
the meantime, we understand that FINRA, in its examinations of dealers for compliance with Rule 15c2-
11, has been examining written supervisory procedures associated with Rule 15c2-11 and bonds but not 
actual compliance with the Rule. We ask FINRA to maintain this examination policy pending possible SEC 
action on this issue. 

BDA welcomes FINRA’s rule modernization review. We believe it presents a compelling opportunity to 
address long-standing issues in the FINRA rule book. We look forward to working with FINRA as the 
review moves forward. 

Sincerely, 

Michael Decker 
Senior Vice President, Research and Public Policy

FINRA Launches Broad Review to Modernize Rules Regarding Member Firms 
and Associated Persons  

Dear Ms. Mitchell: 

We are submitting this letter on behalf of certain clients in response to FINRA Regulatory 
Notice 25-04, FINRA Launches Broad Review to Modernize Rules Regarding Member Firms and 
Associated  Persons  (the  “Notice”),  issued  by  the  Financial  Industry  Regulatory  Authority,  Inc. 
(“FINRA”) on March 12, 2025.1 The Notice solicits comment on areas FINRA should consider as 
part  of  its  rule modernization effort,  including  rules,  guidance, and  processes  that should be  a 
focus for modernization in light of evolving markets, changing business practices, and the adoption 
of new technologies. 

The  clients  on  whose  behalf  we  submit  this  letter  are  diverse  financial  services 
organizations that are in the business of offering and maintaining retirement plan platforms which 
serve  to  provide  access  to  investment  products  typically  offered  through  third  parties  (the 
“Retirement Platforms”). These clients (“Retirement Platform Clients”) rely on a variety of entities 
(both affiliated and unaffiliated) to complete all the functions needed to deliver the Retirement 
Platforms to plan sponsors and participants. Certain functions necessary to the deployment of the 
Retirement  Platforms  are  performed  by  FINRA-member  broker-dealers  (e.g.,  recommending 
particular securities)  while others are performed by separate entities, including retirement plan 
recordkeepers that handle the processing and recordation of participant transactions in the plans 
(“Plan Recordkeepers”) and potentially other parties.   

Although there are differences from one plan arrangement to another, common services 
performed by most Plan Recordkeepers entail three core activities: (1) maintenance of records of 
plan  participant  accounts,  reflecting  contributions  made  to  those  accounts,  investment  option 
allocations  and  changes,  loans,  and  withdrawals;  (2)  maintenance  of  a  call  center,  staffed  by 
telephone  representatives,  who  can  answer  participant  questions  about  their  plan  and  take 
instructions from plan participants concerning the allocation of participant account contributions 
and balances to various investment options and the taking of loans and other distributions under 
the  plan;  and  (3)  participant  enrollment  services,  including  enrollment  effected  through  online 
services, submission of enrollment forms distributed and collected by employer benefits staff, and 
the distribution and collection of enrollment forms at onsite meetings led by recordkeeper staff.

Our  Retirement  Platform  Clients  carefully  define  the  functions  performed  by  Plan 
Recordkeepers  so  as  to  avoid  any  obligation  to  register  them  as  broker-dealers  under  Section 
15(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”), which requires 
the registration of any person engaged in the business of effecting transactions in securities for 
the accounts of others. The delineation of functions is primarily driven by guidance from SEC staff 
in a 1998 no-action letter to Universal Pensions, Inc. (“UPI”) (the “Universal Pensions Letter”), 
where  SEC  staff  indicated  that  broker-dealer  registration  would  not  be  required  for  the 
administrative services proposed to be provided by UPI, a plan recordkeeper not registered as a 
broker-dealer.2 The Universal Pensions Letter outlines certain “clerical and ministerial” services a 
recordkeeper could provide in administrating a retirement plan investing in mutual fund shares 
without triggering the broker-dealer registration requirement.  

We  have  become  aware  of  certain  Retirement  Platform  Clients  having  to  increasingly 
engage  in  debates  with,  and  educate,  FINRA  examination  staff  related  to  the  intricacies  of 
interpreting and applying the Universal Pensions Letter in the context of Retirement Platforms. 
These debates appear to stem from certain misunderstandings around whether a FINRA member 
broker-dealer  is  required  to  supervise  personnel  (either  FINRA-registered  or  not  registered  or 
associated at all with the broker-dealer but rather an employee of another entity with the financial 
services  holding  company)  performing  functions  on  behalf  of  a  Plan  Recordkeeper  that  were 
specifically designated as functions that could be performed by an unregistered “recordkeeper” in 
the  Universal  Pensions  Letter.  These  protracted  debates  with  FINRA  staff  have  introduced 
uncertainty amongst our Retirement Platform Clients as to whether the fundamental principles in 
the Universal Pensions Letter are being applied by FINRA staff through examinations in the way 
that  they  have  been  understood  since  the  issuance  of  the  letter  in  1998.  The  view  of  our 
Retirement Platform Clients has been that the exams take an unduly expansive interpretation of 
the need for supervision by a FINRA member firm of activities and functions that are not even 
being performed by the member firm. 

A  stated  goal  of  FINRA’s  rule  modernization  initiative  is  to  evaluate  where  “FINRA’s 
oversight of its member firms interact with other non-FINRA regulatory requirements in a manner 
that should be a focus for modernization . . . .”3 The recent experience of our Retirement Platform 
Clients in interactions with FINRA staff over the application of the Universal Pensions Letter has 
thrown into question decades of established business practices and highlights a need for FINRA 
guidance in this area.

FINRA Launches Broad Review to Modernize Rules Regarding Member Firms 
and Associated Persons  

Dear Ms. Mitchell: 

We  are  submitting  this  letter  on  behalf  of  the  Committee  of  Annuity  Insurers  (the 
“Committee”),1 in response to FINRA Regulatory Notice 25-04, FINRA Launches Broad Review to 
Modernize Rules Regarding Member Firms and Associated Persons (the “Notice”), issued by the 
Financial Industry Regulatory Authority, Inc. (“FINRA”) on March 12, 2025.2 The Notice solicits 
comment on areas FINRA should consider as part of its rule modernization effort, including rules, 
guidance, and processes that should be a focus for modernization in light of evolving markets, 
changing business practices, and the adoption of new technologies. 

COMMITTEE COMMENTS 

The  Committee  appreciates  the  opportunity  to  submit  comments  in  response  to  this 
Notice,  and  supports  FINRA’s  initiative  to  modernize  its  rules,  guidance,  and  processes.  The 
Committee supports FINRA’s focus on assessing the effectiveness and efficiency of specific FINRA 
rulesets, guidance, and processes with an eye toward “eliminating inefficiencies and reduc[ing] 
unnecessary  burdens.”  The Committee  particularly  appreciates  that  FINRA  has  taken  a  holistic 
view toward rule modernization in considering (and soliciting comment on) whether certain FINRA 
rules  and  processes  may  overlap  with  requirements  that  dual-hatted  broker-dealers  may  be 
subject  to  under  other  regulatory  regimes,  such  as  the  Investment  Advisers  Act  of  1940,  as 
amended (the “Advisers Act”) and/or state insurance law.  

1  The Committee is a coalition of many of the largest and most prominent issuers of annuity contracts. The 
Committee's 32 member companies represent approximately 80% of the annuity business in the United States. 
The Committee was formed in 1981 to address legislative and regulatory issues relevant to the annuity industry 
and to participate in the development of insurance, securities, banking, and tax policies regarding annuities.  
For  over  four  decades,  the  Committee  has  played  a  prominent  role  in  shaping  government  and  regulatory 
policies with respect to annuities at both the federal and state levels, working with and advocating before the 
SEC,  CFTC,  FINRA,  IRS,  Treasury  Department,  and  Department  of  Labor,  as  well  as  the  NAIC  and  relevant 
Congressional  committees.    A  list  of  the  Committee's  member  companies  is  available  on  the  Committee’s 
website at www.annuity-insurers.org/about-the-committee/.

In  this  letter,  the  Committee  focuses  on  six  (6)  topics  that  it  believes  FINRA  should 

prioritize as part of its rule modernization review: 

•  Harmonizing  FINRA’s  rules  with  requirements  under  the  Advisers  Act  and  state 

insurance law; 

•  Aligning FINRA rules with wholesale distribution activities of registered insurance 

products;  

•  Modernizing  FINRA  rules  regarding  gifts,  entertainment,  and  non-cash 

compensation; 

•

1.  Harmonizing FINRA’s  Rules with  Requirements  Under  the  Advisers Act  and 

State Insurance Law  

Committee  members  are  life  insurance  companies,  most  of  which  have  affiliated 
broker-dealers  that  distribute  and/or  sell  SEC-registered  insurance  products  (“registered 
insurance  products”) 3  and  affiliated  investment  advisers  that  recommend  registered 
insurance  products  and/or  provide  advice  to  clients  through  asset  allocation  or  other 
investment advisory programs. Given this structure, Committee members and their affiliated 
companies are subject to multiple regulatory regimes, including FINRA rules, federal securities 
laws  and  regulations,  state  securities  laws  and  regulations,  and  state  insurance  laws  and 
regulations.  

Given the scope and breadth of regulatory requirements to which Committee members 
must  comply,  the  Committee  appreciates  FINRA’s  focus  on  areas  “[w]here  .  .  .  FINRA’s 
oversight  of  its  member  firms  interact  with  other  non-FINRA  regulatory  requirements  in  a 
manner  .  .  .  [that  causes]  unnecessary  or  duplicative  burdens,  insufficiently  tailored 
requirements,  [or]  member  firm  or  investor  confusion.” 4  The  Committee  has  focused  its 
comments in this letter on areas where FINRA requirements overlap with (1) requirements 
applicable to the distribution of registered insurance products under state insurance law and 
(2) requirements applicable to registered investment advisers under the Advisers Act. 

a.  State Insurance Law 

In all states, registered insurance products, and the activities of insurance companies 
who  issue  those  products,  are  regulated  by  the  state’s  insurance  regulatory  authority.  In 
addition,  intermediaries  offering  insurance  products  (e.g.,  insurance  producers)  are  also 
regulated  and  licensed  by  the  applicable  insurance  regulatory  authorities.  State  insurance 
laws and regulations impose a multitude of regulatory requirements on insurance companies 
and insurance producers in connection with the issuance, sale, and marketing of insurance 
contracts relating to such matters as licensing, accounting, investment, solvency, minimum 
capital, reporting, market conduct and sales practices, and consumer protection. Certain of 

3 Many committee members have affiliated broker-dealers that also offer a full menu of securities products to 
retail customers.

these  state  insurance  law  requirements  imposed  on  insurance  producers  can,  at  times, 
overlap  with  FINRA  requirements  imposed  on  broker-dealers  that  sell  registered  insurance 
products.  

One  example  of  such  an  overlap  lies  in  training  and  continuing  education  (“CE”) 
requirements. Under the NAIC Suitability in Annuities Transactions Model Regulation (“Model 
275”),  all  recommendations  by  agents  and  insurers  must  be  in  the  best  interest  of  the 
consumer. 5  Model  275  also  imposes  express  training  obligations  on  insurers  and insurance 
producers  with  respect  to  annuities.  These  are  intended  to  ensure  that  licensed  insurance 
producers understand annuity products generally and also understand the annuity products 
issued  by  a  specific  issuer.  The  insurer’s  supervisory  system  also  must  include  product-
specific training that explains all the material features of its annuity products to its licensed 
insurance producers.  

Model  275’s  training  obligations  apply  to  insurance  producers  that  also  serve  as 
registered representatives associated with FINRA member broker-dealers. FINRA imposes its 
own CE requirements through its two mandatory programs: the Regulatory Element and the 
Firm Element. 6 The Firm Element of FINRA’s CE program requires broker-dealers to establish 
a  formal  training  program  to  keep  registered  persons,  including  individuals  who  maintain 
solely a permissive registration consistent with Rule 1210.02, up to date on topics related to 
professional  responsibility  and  to  the  role,  activities,  and  responsibilities  of  the  registered 
person. 7 The content presented during training intended to comply with Model 275 invariably 
overlaps  with  content  developed  by  an  affiliated  broker-dealer  to  comply  with  the  Firm 
Element.  The  Committee  believes  that  there  are  circumstances  where  registered 
representatives and their firm should be granted express authority to rely on training under 
Model 275 to satisfy requirements under FINRA’s Firm Element requirement (and any other 
applicable CE requirements on a state-by-state basis).  

b.  Advisers Act 

Many Committee members have affiliated investment advisers that recommend registered 
insurance products and/or provide advice to clients through asset allocation or other investment 
advisory  services.  Those  investment  advisers  are  typically  registered  with  the  Securities  and 
Exchange Commission (“SEC”) and subject to the Advisers Act and the regulations thereunder. 
Other Committee members are registered as broker-dealers and as investment advisers. We refer 
to FINRA member firms that are dually registered as investment advisers or that have an affiliated 
investment adviser as “dually-registered firms.” There are a number of areas where FINRA rules 
and/or guidance impose burdensome requirements on dually-registered firms and their associated 
persons in situations where the firms and/or their registered representatives are functioning solely 
in their investment advisory capacity. Below are two examples of this overlap and suggestions as 
to how the withdrawal and/or modification of certain FINRA guidance would help ease regulatory 
burdens on dually-registered firms. 

Communications  Regarding  Advisory  Services.  FINRA’s  General  Counsel’s  office 
issued an interpretive letter in 1998 indicating that NASD Rule 2210, the predecessor to FINRA 
Rule  2210,  prohibits  the  use  of  performance  projections  by  persons  dually-registered  with  a 
member firm and an investment adviser.8 This letter applies Rule 2210 to materials relating to 

5 NAIC’s Model 275 can be found here.

7 See FINRA Rule 1240(b)(2). 

8  See  Interpretive  Letter  to  Dawn  Bond,  FSC  Securities  Corporation,  July  30,  1998,  available  at 
https://www.finra.org/rules-guidance/guidance/interpretive-letters/dawn-bond-fsc-securities-corporation 
(“FSC  Letter”).  For  the  sake  of  convenience,  we  discuss  this  letter  in  the  context  of  FINRA  Rule  2210  even

services provided by a dual registrant, FSC, solely in its investment advisory capacity. Accordingly, 
the letter prohibits the use of material that is permissible (but subject to restrictions, limitations, 
and  affirmative  obligations)  under  Rule  206(4)-1  under  the  Advisers  Act.  The  justification  for 
FINRA’s response was as follows: 

Response: NASD Conduct Rule 2210 (Rule) sets forth specific requirements on the 
use of advertisements and sales literature by members when communicating with 
the public . . . As a registered broker/dealer and member of the NASD, FSC and 
its registered representatives are subject to all of the requirements in the NASD 
Conduct Rules . . . 

It  is  inappropriate  to  apply  FINRA’s  communication  rules  to  dually-registered  firms  and  their 
associated persons if a communication relates solely to investment advisory activity and is subject 
to  Rule  206(4)-1  under  the  Advisers  Act  and/or  the  anti-fraud  provisions  of  the  Advisers  Act. 
Investment advisory services often are fundamentally different from brokerage services in terms 
of  the  role  that  is played  and  the parties  for  whom services  are performed  (e.g.,  offering and 
selling  securities  as  a  direct  or  indirect  agent  of  the  issuer  while  distributing  securities  to  the 
market,  as  compared  to  providing  investment  advice  solely  as  an  agent  to  advisory  clients). 
Applying FINRA’s communications rules, which contemplate an entity acting on the “sell” side to 
an entity acting solely on the “buy” side, makes little sense and often confuses investors as to the 
role engaged in by the dually-registered firm and its associated persons and the protections and 
regulatory regime that apply.  

The FSC Letter also states that: 

Regarding NASD rules, it is important to determine if these materials are being 
used by registered persons of the member and may be considered advertisements 
or  sales  literature  related  to  promoting  the  member's  securities  business.  For 
example,  some dually  registered  persons  engage  in  activities  limited  to  writing 
financial plans for a fee that do not include references to specific securities . . . 
The NASD has not required that the member name be included on such financial 
plans. If, however, particular securities are recommended . . ., NASD Conduct Rule 
2210 would require disclosure of the member's name on the materials. 

We are not aware of FINRA consistently following its own guidance that is quoted in italics above. 
“Promoting the member’s securities business” refers to a broker-dealer promoting its brokerage 
business. It does not refer to a dually-registered firm promoting its or its affiliate’s investment 
advisory business. In the second and third sentences above FINRA distorts the plain meaning of 
“securities  business”  to  include  merely  referring  to  specific  securities  or  to  recommending 
securities. There is no legal basis for interpreting this language in this manner. A mere reference 
to securities or a recommendation of securities is not tantamount to promoting a dually-registered 
firm’s brokerage business. It is worth remembering that no investment adviser can avoid providing 
advice about securities - the definition of investment adviser literally entails a person engaged in 
the  business  of  providing  advice  about  securities  for  compensation.  Thus,  every  investment 
adviser provides investment advice about securities. Accordingly, many, if not most, investment 
advisory marketing pieces will refer to securities. FINRA’s conclusion above has thus meant that 
virtually any advertisement by a dually-registered firm regarding its investment advisory services 
is  subject  to  Rule  2210.  If  a  marketing  piece  promotes  a  dually-registered  firm’s  investment 
advisory services and refers to securities it does not somehow become a promotion of the firm’s 
brokerage  activities.  FINRA  should  begin  interpreting  the  phrase  “promoting  the  member’s 
securities business” in a manner consistent with its plain meaning. 

though the letter preceded this rule and relates to NASD Rule 2210. Likewise, we reference FINRA in discussing 
the letter even though the letter was issued by NASD Regulation, Inc.

The FSC Letter similarly states: 

NASD Conduct  Rule  2210 governs  all  member  communications  with  the public, 
including all third party materials used by a member or its registered persons. In 
administering the rule, however, NASD Regulation has not required the filing of 
marketing materials that are used exclusively to solicit on behalf of an advisory 
business. In accordance with this policy, the staff has not required filing of third-
party  marketing  materials  that:  (i)  purport  to  solicit  customers  for  investment 
advisory services; (ii) do not include the member's name; and (iii) do not contain 
references  to  mutual  funds,  variable  annuities  or  other  securities.”  (Emphasis 
added).9 

Similar  to  the  point  made  above,  the  mere  reference  to  a  dually-registered  firm’s  name  or  to 
securities  does  not  somehow  transform  a  communication  created  by  a  third-party  investment 
adviser (that is not a broker-dealer) into a marketing piece promoting the brokerage business of 
a  dually-registered  firm.  FINRA’s  interpretation  of  the  italicized  language  is  unsupportable  and 
divorced from the plain meaning of the words. Unfortunately, the FSC Letter results in investment 
advisory material created by third-party investment advisers (that are not broker-dealers) being 
subject to Rule 2210 merely because they are handed to dually-registered firms and reference 
securities or the name of the dually-registered firm (even if such firm acts solely in its investment 
advisory capacity with respect to an investment advisory program). The result is illogical. If one 
applied FINRA’s logic in the FSC Letter to the investment advisory regulatory regime, then almost 
every  single  marketing  piece  used  by  a  legal  entity  that  is  both  an  investment  adviser  and  a 
broker-dealer would be subject to Rule 206(4)-1 under the Advisers Act, including those that only 
discuss the entity’s brokerage services (simply because it refers to the name of the entity or refers 
to securities).  

The SEC recently undertook a comprehensive review of Rule 206(4)-1 under the Advisers 
Act  and  significantly  updated  the  rule.  Among  other  things,  the  amended  rule  considered 
investment  advisers  that  also  are  registered  as  broker-dealers.  We  suggest  FINRA  conduct  a 
similar review with respect to Rule 2210 and amend it (and other communication rules) so that 
FINRA  does  not  force dually-registered  firms  and  their  personnel  to  make  disclosures  that  are 
designed  for  entities  that  offer  and  sell  securities  in  offerings,  but  not  for  entities  engaged  in 
discretionary  portfolio  management  or  other  investment  advisory  services.  The  Committee 
recommends that FINRA withdraw or significantly modify the FSC Letter to clarify that material 
used by member firms and/or their associated persons to exclusively promote investment advisory 
services should not be subject to FINRA’s communication rules.  

License  Restrictions  for  Dual-Hatted  Individuals.  FINRA’s  guidance  related  to 
licensing  in  connection  with  investment  advisory  services performed by  dual-hatted  individuals 
dates  back  to  NASD  Regulatory  Notices  94-44  and  96-33.  The  guidance  notes  that  a  limited 
registered representative (such as a representative who only holds a Series 6 license) may not 
execute  transactions  in  securities  not  covered  by  his  or  her  FINRA  registration.  Essentially, 
registration with FINRA as a registered representative subjects an individual to all FINRA rules, 
regulations,  and  requirements,  including  licensing  requirements,  even  if  the  individual  is 
performing  activities  solely  in  his  or  her  advisory  capacity.  As  an  example,  in  NTM  96-33,  the 
NASD stated as follows: 

Question  #4:  Is  it  appropriate  for  a  limited  representative  (i.e.,  a  Series  6 
Investment  Company  Representative)  to  execute  Article  III,  Section  40 
transactions  in  products  such  as equity  securities  that  are  not  covered  by  that 
registration category? 

9 The FSC Letter also contains overly broad language regarding the licensing obligations of advisory personnel 
who play a role in overseeing securities trades placed by third-party investment advisers. 

 
 
 
 
Jennifer Piorko Mitchell

Answer: A limited RR who is otherwise in compliance with applicable federal and 
state registration requirements, such as the SEC's investment adviser registration 
requirements, may not execute transactions in securities not covered by his or her 
NASD  registration.  Registration  with  the  NASD  as  a  representative  subjects  an 
individual to all NASD rules, regulations, and requirements, including qualification 
requirements.  Those  rules  preclude  a  limited  representative  from  acting  as  a 
representative  in  any  area  not  covered  by  his  or  her  registration  category.  A 
limited representative who wishes to execute transactions in securities not covered 
by his or her registration category is required to pass an appropriate qualification 
exam (Emphasis added). 

The  Committee  recommends  that  FINRA  reconsider  this  guidance  and  limit  FINRA’s  licensing 
requirements to only those actions taken while an individual is acting on behalf of his or her broker-
dealer, or on behalf of a person other than a registered investment adviser, bank, savings and 
loan association, credit union, or insurance company. This would be consistent with the last two 
sentences of the above quoted language. In particular, the Committee asks FINRA to clarify that 
when an individual is carrying out an activity exclusively on behalf of an investment adviser, for 
instance, it is not “acting as a representative.” The Committee also asks FINRA to confirm that the 
phrase “execute transactions in securities” requires that commissions or other transaction-based 
compensation be paid in connection with the securities transaction. 

2.  Aligning FINRA’s Rules with Wholesale Distribution Activities 

Committee  members  often  have  broker-dealers  whose  sole  activity  is  to  serve  as  the 
principal  underwriter  or  engage  in  the  wholesale  distribution  (“Distributor  BD”)  of  registered 
insurance  products  issued  by  their  affiliated  insurance  company.  These  Distributor  BDs  do  not 
maintain any customer accounts or hold any customer funds or securities. Those customer account 
relationships are instead maintained by affiliated insurance companies (under insurance laws) and 
separate  retail  broker-dealers  that  sell  the  registered  insurance  products.  Further,  these 
Distributor BDs are often staffed with appropriately registered personnel who are employed by 
their affiliated insurance companies or other management companies and also associated with the 
Distributor BDs.  

Limited Ruleset for Distributor BDs. The Committee recommends that FINRA adopt a 
limited  ruleset  specifically  for  Distributor  BDs.  Their  activities  are  low-risk,  and  many  existing 
FINRA rules impose burdensome requirements that offer no evident investor protection benefits, 
given that these firms do not maintain customer accounts, funds, or relationships. For example, 
FINRA Rule 3110 imposes prescriptive inspection cycles based on whether a particular location is 
classified as an Office of Supervisory Jurisdiction (“OSJ”), branch office, supervisory branch office, 
or non-branch location. These inspection cycles are based entirely on how an office is classified, 
but fail to account for the risk profile of the broker-dealer. This results in a Distributor BD with 
limited operations and no customer accounts or relationships being subject to the same inspection 
requirements as large, retail-focused broker-dealers with more complex operations. In addition, 
these Distributor BDs are too frequently subject to time consuming, and resource draining requests 
from FINRA and other regulatory authorities who request information or descriptions of compliance 
with rules that are inapplicable to their activities.  

The Committee’s request is not without precedent – in 2016, FINRA adopted a dedicated 
ruleset  for  Capital  Acquisition  Brokers  (“CABs”),  recognizing  that  “less  extensive  supervisory 
requirements”  were  appropriate  because  CABs’  activities  were  “limited  to  specific,  lower  risk 
capital  raising.”10  The  Committee  believes  that  similar  treatment  is  warranted  with  respect  to 

10 See, e.g., FINRA Regulatory Notice 25-06, FINRA Requests Comment on Modernizing FINRA Rules, Guidance, 
and Processes to Facilitate  Capital Formation  (March 20, 2025), available here; See also  Regulatory Notice 
16-37, SEC Approves FINRA’s Capital Acquisition (CAB) Rules (Oct. 17, 2016), available here.

broker-dealers whose business activities are limited to acting as principal underwriter or wholesale 
distributor of registered insurance products issued by an affiliate.   

Supervision of Insurance Company Personnel. The Committee asks that FINRA issue 
additional guidance which would serve to create practical and workable boundaries regarding a 
broker-dealer’s  supervisory  obligations,  if  any,  over  personnel  involved  in  the  distribution  of 
registered  insurance  products  at  an  affiliated  insurance  company.  In  1968,  the  SEC  issued  a 
release (the “1968 Release”) excusing an insurance company from registering as a broker-dealer 
if a wholly-owned subsidiary was instead registered as a broker-dealer and, among other things, 
assumed  “full  responsibility  for  the  securities  activities  of  all  insurance  company  personnel 
engaged directly or indirectly in the variable annuity operations.”11 While it is clear that insurance 
agents selling registered insurance products are considered to be engaged in the variable annuity 
operation,  the  1968  Release  did  not  further  elaborate  upon  which  other  insurance  company 
personnel  should  be  considered  to  be  “engaged  directly  or  indirectly  in  the  variable  annuity 
operation” and thus associated with the broker-dealer. This lack of guidance has led to regulatory 
uncertainty and overreaching by FINRA staff into activity which is properly regarded as activity 
engaged  in  by  the  insurer. Committee  members  note  that  over  time, significant  resources  are 
expended  on  debates  with,  and  education  of,  FINRA,  SEC  and  state  securities  regulatory  staff 
related  to  the  intricacies  of  interpreting  and  applying  the  1968  Release  under  specific  factual 
situations.   

3.  Modernizing  Rules  Regarding  Gifts,  Entertainment,  and  Non-Cash 

Compensation 

The  Committee  recommends  that  FINRA  review 

its  rules  regarding  gifts, 
entertainment, and non-cash compensation with the goal of modernizing their requirements. 
The Committee notes that in April 2014, FINRA launched a retrospective review of its gifts, 
gratuities, and non-cash compensation rules to assess their effectiveness and efficiency. 12 In 
December 2014, FINRA published a report on its review, noting that the rules could benefit 
from  updating  to  better  align  the  investor  protection  benefits  and  economic  impacts. 13  In 
August 2016, FINRA published Regulatory Notice 16-29 (“RN 16-29”) soliciting comments on 
changes to the gifts, gratuities, and non-compensation rules, but ultimately decided not to 
move  forward  with  the  proposal. 14  The  Committee  believes  that  FINRA’s  conclusion  in  its 
December 2014 report – namely that the rules could benefit from updating – is even truer 
today,  10  years  later.  The  Committee  highlights  below  two  areas  where  FINRA’s  non-cash 
compensation rules would benefit from amendments and/or further guidance. 15 

Interpretive Position Regarding the Combination of Education Meetings with 
Other  Non-Cash  Awards.  FINRA  Rule  2320(g)(4)(C)  sets  forth  the  requirements  with 
respect to training and education meetings (“T&E Meetings”) held for associated persons by 

11 See Distributions of Variable Annuities by Insurance Companies Broker-Dealer Registration and Regulation 
Problems Under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, Exchange Act Release No. 34-8389 (Aug. 29, 1968). 

12  See  FINRA  Regulatory  Notice  14-15,  FINRA  Requests  Comment  on  the  Effectiveness  and  Efficiency  of  its 
Gifts and Gratuities and Non-Cash Compensation Rules (April 8, 2014), available here. 

13 FINRA Retrospective Rule Review Report: Gifts, Gratuities, and Non-Cash Compensation (December 2014), 
available here. 

14  See  FINRA  Regulatory  Notice  16-29,  FINRA  Requests  Comment  on  Proposed  Amendments  to  Its  Gifts, 
Gratuities and Non-Cash Compensation Rules (Aug. 8, 2016), available here. 

15 The Committee acknowledges FINRA’s May 29, 2025 rule filing with the SEC that would, among other things, 
raise the current $100 gift limit in FINRA Rule 3220 (Influencing or Rewarding Employees of Others) to $250.  
The  Committee  generally  supports  FINRA’s  efforts  to  raise  the  gift  limit  and  plans  to  separately  provide 
comments regarding that proposal.

member firms or offerors. Under the terms of that exception, reimbursement by an offeror is 
permitted  provided  that  certain  conditions  are  met.  In  March  2001,  FINRA  issued  an 
Interpretive Letter taking the position that an “offeror may not pay for golf outings, tours or 
other  forms  of  entertainment  while at a  meeting  it  sponsors  for  the  purpose  of  training  or 
education.” 16  The  Committee  believes  that  this  interpretive  position  is  overly  broad  and 
prescriptive, and fails to take into account the numerous existing safeguards that prevent a 
T&E Meeting from becoming a lavish event, including: (1) limits on the appropriate location 
for  a  T&E  Meeting;  (2)  the  prohibition  on  reimbursement  of  the  costs  for  guests  of  the 
associated  person;  (3)  the  limitations  for  paying  for  expenses  incurred  beyond  the  time 
necessary  for  the  actual  T&E  Meeting;  and  (4)  the  obligation  for  the  training  to  occupy 
“substantially all of the workday.” As a result of these significant limitations, the Committee 
believes  that  FINRA  should  adopt  a  principles-based  standard  and/or  issue  guidance 
recognizing that allowing some type of measured entertainment would not impact the status 
of a T&E Meeting. 

Clarification of an Offeror’s Obligations Under FINRA Rule 2320(g)(4)(E). The 
Committee believes that contributions made by a non-member company under FINRA Rule 
2320(g)(4)(E) could be interpreted as imposing a requirement on the non-member company 
to verify if, for instance, an incentive trip pursuant to FINRA Rule 2320(g)(4)(D) adheres to 
FINRA rules. The Committee requests that FINRA clarify that the non-member company does 
not  have  an  obligation  to  confirm  that  a  member’s  program  conforms  to  the  non-cash 
compensation rules. 

4.  Improving  the  Effectiveness  of  Advertising  Filing  and  Review  Processes 

under FINRA Rule 2210  

The Committee  recommends  that  FINRA  adopt a  more principles-based  and  risk-based 
approach  to  public  communications,  particularly  regarding  filing  requirements  and  supervisory 
pre-review mandates. FINRA Rule 2210 (Communications with the Public) establishes standards 
for how FINRA member firms communicate with the public, including those related to the content 
of communications, principal review and approval, FINRA filing requirements, and recordkeeping. 
Many of these requirements are prescriptive and require firms to file such communication with 
FINRA’s Advertising Regulation Department (the “Department”) and/or subject a communication 
to principal review based on the type of product discussed in the communication, the expected 
audience, and/or the medium through which the communication appears. These requirements are 
excessively  complicated  and,  in  the  experience  of  Committee  members,  do  not  always  bear  a 
relationship  with  the  potential  risks  that  a  communication,  or  the  product  discussed  within  a 
communication, may present. 

Pre-  and  Post-Use  Filing  Requirements.  Of  particular  note  is  Rule  2210(b),  which 
provides a list of communications that must be filed on a pre- or post-use basis with FINRA. In 
Committee members’ experience, the list of materials required to be pre-filed or post-use-filed 
bears  almost  no  relationship  to  the  potential  risks  these  products  present.  The  Committee  is 
particularly  interested  in  the  general  requirement  that  all  variable  product  and  mutual  fund 
communications  be  filed  with  the  Department.  In  the  Committee’s  view,  a  more  risk-based 
approach to the filing requirements would allow FINRA to deploy its advertising review resources 
more strategically, which could include spot-checking material related to various types of securities 
products that the Department believes may present risks to investors, with more attention paid 
to those products that present a higher degree of risk. This approach would be consistent with 
FINRA’s  examination  program  and  guidance  concerning  member  supervisory  systems  and 

16  Letter  from  Mary  Schapiro,  President  NASD  (March  7,  2001)  available  here;  See  also  Regulatory  & 
Compliance Alert (Summer 2000) at p. 13 (“reimbursement or payment for golf outings, tours or other forms 
of entertainment while at a location for the purpose of training or education would not be permissible.”).

compliance programs and would support FINRA’s goal of developing “more efficient and effective 
regulatory requirements.”17  

In offering this comment, the Committee acknowledges that the general requirement to 
file  all  variable product  and  mutual  fund  communications  stems  from  certain provisions  of  the 
federal securities laws, which exempt such communications from SEC filing requirements if they 
are  filed  with  FINRA.  Despite  this  point,  the  Committee  believes  that  FINRA’s  modernization 
initiative,  coupled  with  the  SEC’s  focus  on  facilitating  capital  formation,  presents  a  unique 
opportunity  for  FINRA  to  explore  with  the  SEC  the  possibility  of  a  regulatory  regime  in  which 
variable  product  and  mutual  fund  communications  are  exempt  from  filing,  or  subject  to  a 
principles-based and risk-based approach. 

Department Review of Communications. The Committee encourages FINRA to assess 
its  advertising  review  processes  and  guidance  to  provide  transparency  about  how  its  staff 
interprets  certain  FINRA  rules  and  to  ensure  consistency  amongst  different  FINRA  reviewers. 
Committee members often encounter situations where the Department will adopt an interpretation 
of FINRA’s rules that is inconsistent with and/or directly conflicts with prior interpretations taken 
by the Department. This situation inevitably leads to FINRA not approving communication pieces 
that  have  either  been  approved  in  a  substantially  similar  form  previously  or  are  currently 
circulating from other firms of a similar standing. In addition, particularly in the time period after 
the COVID-19 pandemic, the turn-around time for advertising review has been much longer and 
has negatively impacted the ability to bring registered insurance products to market in a timely 
manner. 

Modernizing  Content  Submission  Processes.  The  Committee  encourages  FINRA  to 
modernize its Advertising Regulation Electronic Files application (the “AREF application”) to allow 
for greater flexibility in the ways in which member firms can provide certain communications to 
FINRA.  For  example,  the  methods  through  which  firms  currently  submit  website  content  are 
outdated  and  could  be  updated  to  allow  for  more  modern  alternatives,  such  as  links  to  non-
production  environments  of  a  website.  The  Committee  believes  that  a  more  modern  approach 
would allow for a more productive dialogue between firms and FINRA staff regarding submitted 
content. 

5.  Assess FINRA Rule 1017 and FINRA’s Membership Application Process 

The Committee believes that FINRA should conduct a comprehensive review of FINRA Rule 
1017 (Application for Approval of Change in Ownership, Control, or Business Operations) and the 
associated membership application process with the goal of developing a risk-based, streamlined 
framework with regard to lower-risk activities. The Committee highlights here two aspects of Rule 
1017 that are, in the Committee’s view, unnecessarily onerous for member firms given their low 
risk: (1) assessing if adding a non-material business line constitutes a “material change in business 
operations”  under  FINRA  Rule  1017(a)(5);  and  (2)  indirect  ownership  changes  requiring  a 
Continuing Membership Application (“CMA”) filing under FINRA Rule 1017(a)(4). The Committee 
also  comments  generally  on  the  New  Membership  Application  (“NMA”)  and  CMA  processes 
themselves,  which  have  in  recent  years  become  an  opportunity  for  FINRA’s  Membership 
Application Program Group (“MAP Group”) to examine firms on certain “hot topics” that are not 
necessarily connected to the application’s original purpose. As a general matter, the Committee 
believes that  many  of  the  recommended  changes  identified  in  FINRA  Regulatory  Notice  18-23, 
Membership  Application  Proceedings:  FINRA  Requests  Comment  on  a  Proposal  Regarding  the 
Rules Governing the New and Continuing Membership Application Process (July 26, 2018) were 
headed in the right direction and a re-proposal of those changes would be beneficial.   

Business Line Materiality Decisions. FINRA Rule 1017(a)(5) requires a CMA filing for 
any “material change in business operations.” FINRA Rule 1011(l) defines a “material change in 

17 See the Notice at pg. 1.  

 
 
 
 
Jennifer Piorko Mitchell

Page 10 

business  operations”  as  including,  but  not  limited  to,  a  change  involving:  (1)  removing  or 
modifying a membership agreement restriction; (2) market making, underwriting, or acting as a 
dealer for the first time; or (3) adding business activities that require a higher minimum net capital 
under Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (“Exchange Act”) Rule 15c3-1. In Committee 
members’ experience, the difficulty and inefficiency of Rule 1017(a)(5) does not stem from these 
three enumerated  categories  of  changes,  but  from  the difficulty  of  analyzing  the materiality  of 
other, non-enumerated changes in business operations.  

For  example, member  firms  that  want  to start a  new  business  line  have to  assess  the 
materiality of that business line with regard to their operations. While NASD Notice to Members 
00-73  provides  some  clarity  regarding  the  type  of  information  broker-dealers  should  consider 
when assessing the “materiality” of a proposed change, often times a firm’s materiality analysis 
ends  up  being  submitted  to  FINRA  in  the  form  of  a  materiality  consultation  letter  (a  “MatCon 
Letter”). The Committee believes that more explicit guidance in this area would be appropriate – 
for example, the Committee believes that FINRA should explicitly except from the term “material 
change in business operations” the addition of business lines that do not impact a firm’s net capital 
or customer protection rule status. This type of change would allow firms to be nimbler in their 
expansion of business lines (which would further facilitate capital formation) and allow FINRA to 
focus its resources on higher-risk changes to a broker-dealer’s operations. 

Indirect Ownership Changes. FINRA Rule 1017(a)(4) requires a CMA for any “change 
in the equity ownership or partnership capital of the member that results in one person or entity 
directly or indirectly owning or controlling 25 percent or more of the equity of partnership capital.” 
In Committee members’ experience, many CMAs filed in connection with Rule 1017(a)(4) pertain 
to indirect ownership changes within a broker-dealer’s corporate structure that have no direct or 
indirect impact on the day-to-day operations of the broker-dealer. Despite the fact that the broker-
dealer’s  operations  will  be  identical  pre-  and  post-indirect  ownership  change,  FINRA  Rule 
1017(a)(4)  subjects  a  firm  to  a CMA  filing,  which  can  often  result  in  substantial  delays  to  the 
closing of certain transactions. Due to the low-risk nature of most indirect ownership changes, the 
Committee suggests FINRA create a significantly streamlined process. Such a process could be 
conditioned on certain factors being satisfied, such as: there will be no change to the direct owner 
of the broker-dealer; there will be no change to the ultimate owner of the broker-dealer; there 
will be no change to the day-to-day operations of the broker-dealer; and no new person will be 
involved in making management decisions for the broker-dealer. In the alternative, an exemption 
or waiver process for such a CMA would be beneficial as well.18 

Committee members often have multiple layers of corporate owners above their broker-
dealers. For tax, cost, or other reasons, they occasionally swap out one intermediate level holding 
company above a broker-dealer for a different intermediate level holding company. Similarly, for 
legal structuring or tax reasons, firms occasionally may seek to add a new intermediate holding 
company above the broker-dealer (e.g., going from 4 intermediate level holding companies above 
a broker-dealer to 5 such companies). Such “internal restacking” transactions pose no substantive 
risks to a broker-dealer or its customers – they merely result in changes to the corporate structure 
that have no real-world consequences whatsoever to the broker-dealer itself. 

More  Focused  CMA  and  NMA  Reviews.  In  recent  years,  Committee  members  have 
observed that the MAP Group’s reviews often stray from the application’s original purpose. This 
leads to extended review times and forces broker-dealers to address issues that are irrelevant to 
the  application.  For  example,  in  connection  with  nearly  every  CMA,  the  MAP  Group  requests 
documentation  regarding  the  broker-dealer’s  ownership  structure,  including  documentation 
regarding all 10% or greater owners. While this review may be useful for CMAs filed in response 
to  ownership  changes,  it  has  no clear  purpose  for a  CMA  filed,  for example, to  operate  a  new 
business  line.  Committee  members  also  recommend  that  FINRA  re-examine  its  guidance  and 
processes related to non-controlling owners of a member firm in the context of a CMA or an NMA. 
Committee  member  experiences  with  filing  CMAs  and  NMAs  has  resulted  in  inconsistent 

18 See FINRA Regulatory Notice 18-23 at p. 17-18.

approaches with respect to the level of detail requested and required by the MAP Group on non-
controlling  firm  owners  and  appears  to  be  subject  to  the  vicissitudes  of  the  reviewing  analyst 
working on the application. In particular, given that many of the owners can be limited partners 
or  non-managing  members  that  have  only  “economic”  interests,  and  not  “management”  or 
“voting”  interests  in  the  Firm,  the  extreme  focus  on  such  non-controlling  parties  is  overly 
burdensome  and  intrusive,  and  can  serve  to  create  a  chilling  effect  on  interest  in  funding 
operations of financial enterprises that include broker-dealer operations.     

6.  Evaluating Internal Transparency and Industry Engagement 

The  Committee  recommends  that  FINRA  evaluate  the  way  in  which  it  interacts  with 
member firms, including through its retrospective rule reviews and Regulatory Notices requesting 
comment on specific rulesets or topics. The Committee appreciates the substantial involvement of 
many in the industry on FINRA’s various Advisory Committees. However, the Committee believes 
that further transparency should be provided regarding the activities of the Advisory Committees 
and FINRA’s decision-making process regarding whether they move ahead with certain proposals 
or initiatives. There are a number of examples over the past 15 years in which FINRA requested 
comment in connection with a retrospective rule review or Regulatory Notice where, after receiving 
substantial industry comment, FINRA failed to provide any meaningful update on the status of the 
proposal. One example is FINRA’s retrospective rule review and resulting Regulatory Notice related 
to gifts, entertainment, and non-cash compensation (discussed above), for which no meaningful 
update  has  been  provided  for  nearly  10  years.19  The  Committee  believes  that  FINRA  should 
develop a process through which it reports back to the industry on its various initiatives, including 
telling the industry whether certain contemplated rule changes will move forward or be closed out.

CONCLUSION 

The  Committee  appreciates  the  opportunity  to  provide  these  comments  on  the  Notice. 
Please  do  not  hesitate  to  contact  Clifford  Kirsch  (212.389.5052  or  CliffordKirsch@eversheds-

","We  are  submitting  this  letter  on  behalf  of  the  Committee  of  Annuity  Insurers  (the “Committee”),1 in response to FINRA Regulatory Notice 25-04, FINRA Launches Broad Review to Modernize Rules Regarding Member Firms and Associated Persons (the “Notice”), issued by the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority, Inc. (“FINRA”) on March 12, 2025.2 The Notice solicits comment on areas FINRA should consider as part of its rule modernization effort, including rules, guidance, and processes that should be a focus for modernization in light of evolving markets, changing business practices, and the adoption of new technologies. In  1968,  the  SEC  issued  a release (the “1968 Release”) excusing an insurance company from registering as a broker-dealer if a wholly-owned subsidiary was instead registered as a broker-dealer and, among other things, assumed  “full  responsibility  for  the  securities  activities  of  all  insurance  company  personnel engaged directly or indirectly in the variable annuity operations.”11 While it is clear that insurance agents selling registered insurance products are considered to be engaged in the variable annuity operation,  the  1968  Release  did  not  further  elaborate  upon  which  other  insurance  company personnel  should  be  considered  to  be  “engaged  directly  or  indirectly  in  the  variable  annuity operation” and thus associated with the broker-dealer. In  March  2001,  FINRA  issued  an Interpretive Letter taking the position that an “offeror may not pay for golf outings, tours or other  forms  of  entertainment  while at a  meeting  it  sponsors  for  the  purpose  of  training  or education.” 16  The  Committee  believes  that  this  interpretive  position  is  overly  broad  and prescriptive, and fails to take into account the numerous existing safeguards that prevent a T&E Meeting from becoming a lavish event, including: (1) limits on the appropriate location for  a  T&E  Meeting;  (2)  the  prohibition  on  reimbursement  of  the  costs  for  guests  of  the associated  person;  (3)  the  limitations  for  paying  for  expenses  incurred  beyond  the  time necessary  for  the  actual  T&E  Meeting;  and  (4)  the  obligation  for  the  training  to  occupy “substantially all of the workday.” As a result of these significant limitations, the Committee believes  that  FINRA  should  adopt  a  principles-based  standard  and/or  issue  guidance recognizing that allowing some type of measured entertainment would not impact the status of a T&E Meeting.",0.9999,0.09,0.025

RE: Regulatory Notice 25-04, FINRA Launches Broad Review to Modernize Rules Regarding Member 
Firms and Associated Persons  

Dear Ms. Mitchell:  

LPL Financial Holdings, Inc. (“LPL” or “the Firm”) appreciates the opportunity to provide comments on 
Regulatory Notice 25-04, FINRA Launches Broad Review to Modernize Rules Regarding Member Firms and 
Associated Persons (the “request for comment”). As the financial services industry evolves, we believe that it is 
critical for the regulatory rulebook to likewise advance to reflect the way firms operate today. 

FINRA’s broad request for comment represents an important opportunity for the regulated community to 
collaborate with regulators to modernize the current rulebook. Many FINRA rules were first implemented by the 
National Association of Securities Dealers (“NASD”) and have not been meaningfully revisited since the 
incorporation of the New York Stock Exchange (“NYSE”) regulatory division rules in 2007. We are grateful that 
FINRA is providing member firms with the opportunity to help prioritize rule changes that ensure that the 
rulebook reflects the current state of industry operations.   

LPL is recommending that FINRA clarify confusing or outdated rules, amend rules to create efficiencies, take 
steps to encourage industry growth and the development of the next generation of financial professionals and 
lead industry-wide initiatives that help alleviate operational challenges. These recommendations are discussed 
below and will be further discussed in response to Regulatory Notice 25-071 (“RN 25-07”).  

I. 

Overview of LPL 

LPL Financial Holdings, Inc. is a retail investment advisory firm and independent broker-dealer operating in all 
50 states and the parent company of two dually registered FINRA member firms. We are steadfast in our belief 
that Americans deserve access to personalized guidance from a financial professional. LPL serves as a trusted 
partner to more than 29,500 financial professionals and the wealth management practices at approximately 
1,200 financial institutions, servicing and custodying approximately $1.8 trillion in brokerage and advisory 
assets on behalf of approximately 8 million Americans.

Member FINRA/SIPC  

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
We provide our financial professionals with the technology, research, clearing and compliance services and 
practice management programs they need to serve their clients and create thriving businesses. Our financial 
professionals offer investment and financial education, financial planning, access to investment products and 
brokerage services, and personalized investment advice to investors seeking wealth management, retirement 
planning, financial planning and asset management solutions.  

II. 

Recommendations for Rule Modernization  

FINRA’s recognition that the rulebook should be updated builds on recent coordination with the industry to 
adopt new rules through a collaborative process that ensures that the rules can be operationalized, provide 
important investor protection and are not unduly burdensome.  

LPL’s comments represent suggestions both from our home office and from our registered representatives. As 
financial professionals who work within the constructions of the FINRA rulebook when interacting with clients 
every day, they are uniquely positioned to provide feedback on the practicalities of rules and to identify 
instances where FINRA rules are unclear or unduly challenging to comply with.  

FINRA Should Prioritize Modernizing Confusing and Outdated Rules   

We believe that FINRA has the opportunity to make small yet significant changes to the rulebook that would 
have a meaningful impact on day-to-day operations for broker-dealers and financial professionals. In some 
instances, these rules have not been updated in years, or the industry is relying on decades-old guidance. There 
is an opportunity to alleviate unnecessary friction and evolve rules to reflect our current operating environment.  

We urge FINRA to swiftly propose changes to the following rules:  

•  Provide explicitly that broker-dealers may pay commissions to unregistered entities that registered 

representatives of independent-broker dealers often form to establish their own businesses2. Notably, 
payment of advisory fees to such entities is permissible under SEC rules so this will streamline the 
payment of fees to independent ﬁnancial professionals.  

•  Remove the obligation for broker-dealers to supervise unaffiliated investment advisers, as stated in 

Notice to Members 94-44 and Notice to Members 96-33 and further discussed in comments from LPL 
Financial in response to Regulatory Notice 25-05 3. We also suggest that FINRA review the related 
requirement for representatives to have speciﬁc FINRA licenses when trading products in their capacity 
as an investment adviser.   

•  Review the Options Rule requirement 4 that any branch with more than three representatives transacting 
in options trading designate a Registered Options Principal or Limited Principal – General Securities 
Sales Supervisor.

There is a Significant Opportunity to Create Operational Efficiencies  

In some instances, the FINRA rulebook reflects a time when broker-dealers were heavily reliant on paper, 
mailings and less sophisticated technology. Advances over the past decade, which were accelerated by the 
coronavirus pandemic and the need to work remotely, have resulted in a workplace that relies much more 
heavily on automated, computerized tools for day-to-day operations. This means that systems are more 
efficient, surveillance is more robust, and basic tasks can be executed more quickly.  

Certain FINRA rules are at odds with the modern workplace and meaningful updates are needed to better 
harmonize with current practices. While we will be addressing these issues in more detail in our comments 
responding to RN 25-07, we ask FINRA to revisit the following rules for modernization:  

•  Update paper mailing requirements under Rule 2231 and Rule 2232 to allow ﬁrms to use the same 
envelope for mailing of documents within the same household and consider allowing for trade 
conﬁrmations to be batched and sent at a set frequency, such as once per month. We also encourage 
FINRA to work with the SEC to update electronic delivery requirements, allowing ﬁrms to default 
customers to electronic delivery for account documents.  
Expand the FINRA Fingerprint Program categories by designating additional overseas electronic 
ﬁngerprint vendors as acceptable and revisit the deﬁnition of “Associated Persons Exempt from 
Registration 5” to include individuals who provide basic operational and processing functions.   

• 

•  Provide clarifying guidance that during customer account conversion a broker-dealer has the ability to 
immediately convert the account into the most similar product within the ﬁrm’s eligible products (e.g. 
sweep product), rather than the most substantially similar product. This will reduce customer confusion 
and friction when the accounts are later converted to the most similar product.  

We Can Work Together to Nurture Industry Growth and Develop the Next Generation of Talent  

LPL believes that everyone deserves access to personalized financial guidance and advice from financial 
professionals. Recent research found that 80% of respondents want access to a human financial advisor6 while 
at the same time advisor headcount continues to stay stagnant while gradually increasing in age 7. It is of vital 
importance that the industry works together with regulators to expand our reach and to develop a strong 
pipeline of talent to meet the increasing demand for advice and help prepare a next generation of advisors to 
meet investor needs. Recent programs, including FINRA’s Maintaining Qualifications Program (“MQP”) and 
NASAA’s Exam Validity Extension Program (“EVEP”) are helpful tools for encouraging individuals to reenter the 
industry after a hiatus by maintaining qualifications through continuing education.

7 Ibid  

 
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
There are additional steps that FINRA and member firms can take together to encourage the next generation of 
financial professionals to join the industry, some of which are discussed in LPL comments to FINRA in response 
to Regulatory Notice 21-17 8. These actions include:  

•  Continuing outreach programs to increase awareness of the SIE and consideration of a grant fund to 
allow candidates to take the exam with a subsidized fee or a program to offer reduced cost study 
materials9.  

•  Allow individuals to take the Series 6 or Series 7 exams without ﬁrm sponsorship, building on the 
success of the SIE and helping create a pool of hire-ready candidates for positions that require 
licensing10.  

•  Review CE requirements imposed by FINRA, state securities regulators and national accrediting 

organizations to harmonize duplicative requirements and coordinate content that satisﬁes multiple 
requirements. 

FINRA Can Drive Change by Leading Industry-Wide Initiatives  

One of the most important roles that FINRA plays is that of an industry convener, offering a forum for member 
organizations to collaborate, innovate and develop solutions to problems faced by a variety of firms. We believe 
that there are new opportunities for FINRA to leverage existing systems, information already gathered by FINRA 
and the SEC, and wide reach to firms of all sizes in order to support industry initiatives and collectively solve 
challenges.  

We recommend that FINRA lead dialogue between member firms, regulators, and industry stakeholders on the 
following initiatives:  

•  Create and maintain a public, centralized database of mutual fund fee changes, which would take the 

onus of tracking fee changes off broker-dealers and provide retail investors with enhanced transparency 
of various fees.  
Explore the possibility of working with the Depository Trust and Clearing Corporation (DTCC) and other 
interested parties to automate non-ACATs transfers.  
Launch a widespread campaign to educate consumers on ways to identify fraud, highlighting emerging 
trends and prevalent schemes that member ﬁrms are combatting.

Re: FINRA Regulatory Notice 25-04 (FINRA Requests Comment on Review to Modernize 
Rules Regarding Member Firms and Associated Persons)  

Dear Ms. Mitchell: 

On March 12, 2025, the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA) issued Regulatory 

Notice 25-04 to request comment on its review to modernize its rules.1 The Financial Services 
Institute (FSI) commends FINRA for undertaking this initiative to broadly review its rules with 
modernization in mind, particularly its focus on potential updates to its rules and regulatory 
approaches in light of non-FINRA requirements applicable to members. FSI appreciates the 
opportunity to comment on this important proposal. We support a review of FINRA’s rules and 
regulatory approaches in light of broader industry developments, such as the SEC Regulation Best 
Interest (Reg BI) and the SEC’s Marketing Rule. In addition, this initiative to modernize FINRA’s 
rules is important because of technological advancements and evolving industry business models 
and practices. FSI offers select comments in this letter and will offer additional comments more 
specifically tied to workplace modernization in response to Regulatory Notice 25-07. FSI’s 
comments are informed by the perspective of dually registered firms, while also addressing 
several additional areas that may benefit from modernization. 

Background on FSI Members 

The independent financial services community has been an important and active part of 
the lives of American investors for more than 40 years. In the US, there are more than 152,000 
independent financial advisors.2 These financial advisors are self-employed independent 
contractors, rather than employees of the Independent Broker-Dealers (IBD).3 

FSI’s IBD member firms provide business support to independent financial advisors in 

addition to supervising their business practices and arranging for the execution and clearing of 
customer transactions. Independent financial advisors are small-business owners and job creators

with strong ties to their communities. These financial advisors provide comprehensive and 
affordable financial services that help millions of individuals, families, small businesses, 
associations, organizations, and retirement plans. Their services include financial education, 
planning, implementation, and investment monitoring. Due to their unique business model, FSI 
member firms and their affiliated financial advisors are especially well positioned to provide 
Main Street Americans with the affordable financial advice, products, and services necessary to 
achieve their investment goals. 

FSI members make substantial contributions to our nation’s economy. According to Oxford 

Economics, FSI members nationwide generate $35.7 billion in economic activity. This activity, in 
turn, supports 408,743 jobs including direct employees, those employed in the FSI supply chain, 
and those supported in the broader economy. In addition, FSI members contribute nearly $7.2 
billion annually to federal, state, and local government taxes.4  

Discussion 

I. 

Rule Modernization Presents Opportunity for Better Aligned Rules for Dual 
Registrants  

FSI appreciates the opportunity to comment, as FINRA’s review presents an opportunity to 

better harmonize broker-dealer (BD) and investment adviser (RIA) regulations, an issue 
particularly important to dual registrants. FINRA’s review is timely given that many of its rules 
derive from a time when BD and RIA care obligations were less aligned and broker-dealer and 
advisory businesses were largely separate. Given the realities of today’s broker-dealer business, 
FSI encourages greater consistency between BD and RIA standards to reduce operational 
complexity, including in areas such as advertising, supervision, and recordkeeping.

Given that the SEC’s Marketing Rule has been in full effect since 2022, this is a beneficial time 
for FINRA to review its advertising rules with an eye toward regulatory modernization, increased 
adoption of a principles-based approach, and the reduction of burdens and regulatory 
complexity for dually registered firms. One example is FINRA regulatory guidance that stems 
from 1998 in the form of an interpretive letter to Dawn Bond at FSC Securities.5 This letter 
clarified FINRA’s regulatory expectations for certain advisory activity of registered persons under 
FINRA’s advertising and communications rules. In doing so, many dual registrants face additional 
advertising review for communications geared toward advisory services. With the SEC’s 
Marketing Rule in place, this is one example of an area where FINRA should review and 
modernize its advertising and communications guidance. FINRA should reconsider its approach 
under this guidance and likely narrow the scope so that communications for advisory services are 
not subsumed into BD communications covered by FINRA advertising and communications rules and 
reviews. FSI also encourages FINRA to explore principles-based frameworks to further modernize 
its advertising and communications rules, facilitate a risk-based approach to required advertising 
reviews and approvals, and identify opportunities to harmonize with the SEC’s Marketing Rule to 
promote regulatory consistency.

B.  Books and Records Requirements 

FINRA should work with the SEC and collaborate with the industry to modernize books and 
records requirements. Lawmakers and regulators established books and records requirements 
during a time when communication methods and technologies were vastly different from those 
used by firms and investors today.6 For example, historical communications methods (for both 
internal and external communications) include internal memos, mail/letters, email, phone logs, and 
faxes. While books and records rules and related regulatory guidance have sought to keep pace 
with technological development, the Covid and post-Covid era accelerated the adoption of 
modern communication tools, including widespread use of smartphones, text messaging, and video 
conferencing.7 Investors expect those in the financial services industry to use modern technologies 
to facilitate convenient and rapid communication.  

Financial services firms also seek to use new technologies for both communications and data 
storage. Technologies like Slack, Microsoft Teams, and Zoom can promote efficient communication 
in the workplace. Overly burdensome requirements may inhibit firms’ ability to adopt innovative 
technologies to communicate. In addition, rules should not unintentionally restrict or discourage the 
use of modern retention and storage technologies that enable efficient, economical, and secure 
record preservation.  

In addition, FINRA should review other areas of its rulebook that require the creation and 
retention of certain records (e.g., FINRA Rules 2210, 4512, and 2232) to determine whether 
there are opportunities for simplification and consolidation. FINRA should also explore 
opportunities to align its requirements with those covering registered investment advisers. FSI 
encourages regulators to work with the industry to examine whether the books and records 
requirements can be better tailored to the modern world.     

C.  Supervision Obligations 

FSI encourages FINRA to consider revising its supervisory rules to adopt a more principles-

based approach and review the possibility of aligning obligations under those rules to the 
supervisory framework applicable to registered investment advisers. FSI encourages FINRA to 
review FINRA Rules 3110, 3120, 3130, collectively, to determine whether they can be 
streamlined and structured to better align them with those governing registered investment 
advisers. For example, certain obligations, such as the annual testing requirement, impose 
additional compliance obligations on BDs. In addition, FINRA should review other areas of its 
rulebook that specifically address supervision, such as Rule 2330, to determine their necessity 
and explore streamlining opportunities with Rules 3110-3130. More generally, a principles-
based supervisory framework allows firms to tailor their compliance programs based on their 
specific business models and risk profiles, promoting more effective and efficient supervision. 
Such an approach would enable firms to allocate resources more strategically, enhancing overall 
compliance and investor protection.

II. 

Additional Areas for Consideration: Form U4, Electronic Delivery, and Gift Limits 

A.  Form U4 

FSI encourages FINRA to review rules and instructions on disclosing customer complaints on 
Form U4 with the goal of fairness and accuracy. Current rules require disclosure of complaints 
alleging sales practice violations with claimed damages of $5,000 or more, even when denied 
and unsupported by firm findings of misconduct. This practice may create irreparable and unfair 
reputational harm. FINRA could collaborate with the industry to find solutions that preserve 
investor protection while reducing disclosures that prove to be inaccurate and reputationally 
damaging for financial professionals. A better-tailored approach would also reduce the need for 
expungement, and ease administrative burdens on both firms and regulators. 

B.  Electronic Delivery (“E-Delivery”)  

FSI encourages FINRA to review opportunities to expand the use of e-delivery for investor 
communications and to work with other regulators to support e-delivery. As highlighted in the joint 
industry paper “E-Delivery: Modernizing the Regulatory Communications Framework to Meet 
Investor Needs for the 21st Century,”8 electronic delivery offers a faster, more secure, and more 
convenient method for disseminating information to investors. Implementing a framework that 
allows for electronic delivery by default, with the option for investors to opt for paper delivery, 
would align regulatory practices with current investor preferences and technological 
advancements. This approach would enhance investor engagement and reduce operational costs 
for firms, without compromising the availability or quality of information provided to investors. 

C.  Gifts Limits 

FSI commends FINRA for its recent proposal filed with the SEC to amend FINRA Rule 3220, 
which governs the limits on gifts and business entertainment. The proposed rule change increases 
the gift limit from $100 to $250 per person per year, acknowledging inflationary changes and 
the evolving nature of business relationships. FSI intends to submit a comment on the proposal and 
supports modernizing FINRA’s gift rules.  

Conclusion 

FSI is committed to constructive engagement in the regulatory process and welcomes the 

opportunity to work with FINRA on this and other important regulatory efforts. Thank you for 
considering FSI’s comments. Should you have any questions, please contact me at (202) 393-

RE:  Regulatory Notice 25-04: Rule Modernization; 

Regulatory Notice 25-06: Supporting Capital Formation 

Dear Ms. Mitchell: 

On behalf of the North American Securities Administrators Association, Inc. (“NASAA”),1 
I am writing in response to Financial Industry Regulatory Authority, Inc. (“FINRA”) Regulatory 
Notice 25-04: Rule Modernization and Regulatory Notice 25-06: Supporting Capital Formation,2 
which  seek  commentary  to  inform  FINRA’s  “broad  review  of  its  regulatory  requirements 
applicable to member firms and associated persons.” While NASAA may comment on specific 
proposals if and when they are issued by FINRA, we offer the following general principles to help 
guide FINRA’s review. First, the prospective modernization of FINRA rules should be narrow and 
targeted,  and  should  prioritize  investor  protection.  Second,  FINRA  should  work  to  promote 
responsible  capital  formation  by  maintaining  rules  for  oversight  of  private  offerings  and  those 
promoting them. 

I. 

The modernization of FINRA rules should be narrow and targeted, and should 
prioritize investor protection. 

In the two Notices, FINRA seeks comments broadly on how its rules might be modernized 
in light of other regulatory schemes that apply to FINRA member firms and broader developments 
in  the  markets,  products,  services,  and  technology.  The  two  initial  areas  of  focus  identified  in 
Regulatory Notice 25-04 – capital formation and the modern workplace – implicate a wide array 
of  important  rules  and  guidance  designed  to  protect  investors  and  the  markets  from  fraud  and 

Organized in 1919, NASAA is the oldest international organization devoted to investor protection. 

1  
NASAA’s membership consists of the securities administrators in the 50 states, the District of Columbia, Canada, 
México, Puerto Rico, the U.S. Virgin Islands, and Guam. NASAA is the voice of securities agencies responsible for 
grass-roots investor protection and efficient capital formation.

abuse.3 Therefore, it  is imperative  that  any  adjustments in  these  areas  be  narrow,  targeted, and 
precise. Where possible, revisions should be informed by empirical data through mechanisms like 
compliance inspections, examination sweeps, and properly-designed pilot programs, rather than 
bare FINRA member firm preferences and speculation. 

FINRA should also avoid rule changes that favor certain technologies, products, services, 
or business models at the expense of investor protection. NASAA has consistently advocated for 
stronger requirements to ensure that developments in products, practices, and technology do not 
leave investor protection considerations behind.4 Unfortunately, the two Notices appear to invite 
such  a  result  by  unduly  favoring  the  reduction  of  regulatory  requirements  over  the  investor 
protection benefit  of  existing FINRA rules.  Technologies like  artificial  intelligence, distributed 
ledger technology, and new web and mobile applications can help to expand participation in our 
capital  markets,  but  they  come  with  risks.  Many  of  these  risks  are  familiar,  despite  new 
technological  wrappers,  but  emerging  technologies  can  exacerbate  existing  risks  or  change  the 
manner in which they materialize.5 

FINRA  should  therefore  avoid  changes  that  favor  emerging  technologies,  products, 
services, or business models, or otherwise allow them to operate outside of existing safeguards 
that  have  been  carefully  designed  to  protect  investors  from  well-understood  risks  of  fraud  and 
abuse. Instead, FINRA should continue to apply well-established principles to protect investors 
from similar risks, regardless of the technology or investment product, and FINRA member firms 
should  continue  to  focus  first  on  their  duties  to  investors  when  providing  new  trading  tools, 
services,  and  products.  For  example,  we  believe  that  existing  rules  already  cover  most  digital 
engagement practices and technology-based recommendations and investment advice.6 However, 
we believe that FINRA has not paid sufficient attention to parsing the circumstances in which these 
practices are and are not recommendations, and that this gap should not be further exacerbated in

the face of continuing technological advancement.7 We recommend that FINRA strengthen the 
existing framework by providing guidance about when these practices are recommendations and 
requiring FINRA member firms to understand and disclose the limits and potential conflicts of 
these innovations to their customers. 

II. 

FINRA  should  work  to  promote  responsible  capital  formation  by  maintaining 
rules for oversight of private offerings and those promoting them. 

FINRA should exercise particular care when considering updates to its rules concerning 
oversight of the private securities markets, with respect to both private offerings themselves and 
the people and firms promoting them. Regulatory Notice 25-06 asks whether FINRA should create 
a “tailored rule set” for ostensibly limited-purpose broker-dealers, including finders. 

As NASAA has cautioned in the past when opposing proposals to carve finders out of the 
existing  regulatory  framework,  the  private  markets  are  known  to  be  prone  to  abuse.8  State 
securities  regulators  frequently  see  fraud  and  other  harms  where  unregistered  persons  promote 
unregistered investments to retail investors.9 While data about the private markets remains limited, 
a staff white paper published by the SEC’s Division of Economic and Risk Analysis noted that 
“offerings linked to SEC enforcement actions more likely involved an unregistered intermediary 
or a recidivist, or solicited from unsophisticated investors.”10 This is consistent with the experience 

See, e.g., Robert W. Cook, Statement Before the Financial Services Committee U.S. House of 

7  
Representatives (May 6, 2021) (noting that “a broker-dealer’s customer interface that promotes trading activity . . . 
is also potentially subject to Reg BI, depending on the facts and circumstances” (emphasis added)); Sarah Aberg & 
Shane Killeen, Game On: FINRA Hints at Upcoming Gamification Sweep, Sheppard Mullin, Corporate & Securities 
Law Blog (June 2, 2021) (noting that “speakers [at FINRA’s annual conference] indicated that any future 
rulemaking, guidance or regulatory action [by FINRA] regarding gamification would be undertaken in conjunction 
with the [SEC]”).

of state securities  regulators.11 The staff also observed  that  studies indicate that  “fraud  is more 
likely  to  occur  when  there  are  fewer  outside  gatekeepers  like  underwriters,  analysts  and 
regulators.” 12  Given  the  experiences  of  state  securities  regulators,  available  evidence,  and  the 
obvious dangers of combining unregistered promoters with unregistered offerings, this is not an 
area where regulatory safeguards should be weakened. 

Controls  such  as  licensing,  registration,  and  examination  or  inspection  serve  essential 
gatekeeper  functions,  and  FINRA  rules  impose  additional  controls  on  broker-dealers  for  good 
reason. This includes rules requiring firms and associated persons to adhere to a high standard of 
conduct, supervise their activities effectively, know their customers, understand the products they 
are selling, and keep and maintain records to ensure that regulators have the information they need 
to fulfill their roles. As FINRA President and CEO Robert Cook has aptly stated,  

[an]  advantage  that  has  traditionally  been  identified  is  that  SROs  can  raise  the 
standard  of  conduct  in  the  industry.  This  benefit  is  most  apparent  in  the  ethical 
requirements  and  detailed business  conduct rules that an SRO can establish that 
extend beyond the realm of federal law. These standards can deter dishonest and 
unfair  practices  that  might  not  amount  to  fraud,  but  nonetheless  can  undermine 
investor confidence and compromise capital formation.13 

FINRA should not back away from these important controls or otherwise take steps to weaken its 
role in the oversight of its members’ activities in the private markets. 

Regulatory Notice 25-06 further asks whether FINRA should reconsider certain aspects of 
FINRA Rule 2310 and requests suggestions for exemptions that FINRA should consider from the

requirements of FINRA Rules 5122 and 5123. FINRA should exercise caution in these areas as 
well. 

FINRA Rule 2310 establishes certain suitability, disclosure, and other requirements that 
must be met before a FINRA member firm may participate in a public offering of certain direct 
participation  programs.  These  products  are  typically  expensive,  illiquid,  and  involve  a  greater 
degree of risk than other publicly offered investments. Given the complexity of these products, 
FINRA  member  firms  serve  an  important  gatekeeper  function  when  offering  and  selling  them, 
particularly  to  retail  investors.14  State  securities  enforcement  actions  over  the  years  have 
demonstrated the investor harm that can occur when firms do not adequately fulfill this role.15 As 
such,  we  believe  that  the  requirements  and  protections  established  in  Rule  2310  remain  both 
important and relevant to protect investors, and this too is an area where regulatory safeguards 
should not be weakened. 

For private placements of securities issued by FINRA member firms, FINRA Rule 5122 
currently requires that the firm provide basic disclosures, file the relevant offering documents and 
any retail communications (i.e., advertisements) about the offering with FINRA, and requires that 
the firm actually use a certain portion of the offering proceeds for business purposes. For other 
private placements, FINRA Rule 5123 requires only that a FINRA member firm file the offering 
documents  and  advertisements  with  FINRA,  or  tell  FINRA  that  no  offering  documents  or 
advertisements were used. Both rules include specified exemptions, including for offerings sold 
only  to  types  of  investors  who  could  plausibly  be  considered  sophisticated  enough  to  fend  for 
themselves.  The  requirements  in  these  rules  are  basic  and  commonsense,  and  they  serve  an 
important  purpose  that  facilitates  continued  trust  in  our  capital  markets.16  FINRA  should  be 
skeptical of comments suggesting that these rules serve as barriers to capital formation.

More  specifically,  skepticism  is  warranted  for  any  suggestion  that  FINRA  exempt,  or 
loosen requirements for, offerings sold solely to natural person accredited investors from its rules. 
As NASAA has explained in the past, the current income and net worth criteria for “accredited” 
status are not an effective proxy for financial sophistication, especially since they have not been 
meaningfully updated since 1982.17 Even the most sophisticated investors will struggle to make 
sound  investment  decisions  if  they  are  given  bad  recommendations  or  deprived  of  material 
information.  Indeed,  NASAA  has  consistently  urged  policymakers  to  enhance,  not  weaken, 
protections in the private markets by providing better and more timely information to investors, 
firms,  and  regulators. 18  We  therefore  urge  FINRA  not  to  weaken  Rule  2310  or  discard  the 
fundamental  oversight  and  modest  regulatory  burden  under  Rules  5122  and  5123  for  private 
offerings sold to these investors.

Re: 

FINRA Regulatory Notice 25-04; Rule Modernization   

Dear Ms. Mitchell,  

Thank you for the opportunity to provide feedback in response to FINRA’s request for 

comment on a proposal to modernize its rules. We write this comment on behalf of the Securities 
Arbitration Clinic at St. John’s University School of Law. The Clinic is part of the St. Vincent de 
Paul Legal Program, Inc., a not-for-profit legal services organization. The Clinic represents 
underserved investors with small dollar claims and is committed to investor protection and 
education.  

The Clinic supports FINRA’s efforts to modernize its rules and the initial focus on rules 

related to capital formation and the modern workplace. We plan to comment in more detail on 
these topics in response to Regulatory Notices 25-06 and 25-07. More broadly, as FINRA 
reviews its regulatory requirements, we emphasize the importance of FINRA maintaining a focus 
on investor protection, particularly of the most vulnerable investors. This should include a focus 
on senior investors, who often face a heightened risk of harm from complex products, as well as 
newer and younger investors, who may be more susceptible to misleading communications and 
misinformation in today’s digital age. 

As FINRA modernizes, it should prioritize protecting senior investors and others from 

the risks of harm from complex products. FINRA has demonstrated its commitment to protecting 
senior investors in part through its Securities Helpline for Seniors, which marked its 10th 

1 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
anniversary this year.1 In 2022, FINRA requested comment on the topic of complex products 
generally. We urge FINRA to continue to examine the issues raised by the Clinic in response to 
that request for comment as part of its ongoing efforts to protect senior investors in a complex 
and evolving financial marketplace.2  

Additionally, FINRA should prioritize protecting and educating newer and younger 
investors, who often invest without the advice of a financial professional. In 2021, FINRA 
requested comment in a Special Notice on the topic of educating newer investors. The Clinic 
commented in response to that Special Notice, and specifically recommended that FINRA 
provide guidance regarding communication strategies, including with respect to social media, 
third party sources, layered messaging, and visual design tools such as color psychology.3 We 
continue to believe this is an important topic deserving of FINRA’s attention as it considers 
which rules to prioritize for modernization. 

Thank you for the opportunity to comment on these crucial issues.

Re: Regulatory Notice 25-04 – Rule Modernization  

Introduction 
Ken Norensberg, CEO of Luxor Financial Group, Inc and former Member of the FINRA Board 
of Governors, is grateful for the opportunity to comment on Regulatory Notice 25-04. As a 
nationally recognized regulatory and broker dealer compliance consulting firm, Luxor Financial 
Group regularly consults with broker dealers and their registered representatives and has heard 
their concerns. As such, we can voice their concerns by presenting this comment letter as 
follows:  

General Comments 
As this notice is of a general nature, my comments will touch on several subjects with the intent 
of bringing attention to items which affect existing Members as well as potential Members who 
are filing FINRA New Member Applications.  

All FINRA Rules need to have a risk-based approach. Over the years Members have heard from 
FINRA that they are taking a Risk Based Approach to the rules and the enforcement of these 
Rules. When speaking with Members, the response is always that FINRA is taking a heavy hand 
through “regulation by enforcement” and that new and existing Rules start out seeking to solve 
an issue and then transform into other items which become overburdensome to Firms. Firms then 
feel like they are trying to adjust to Rules which continue to evolve into nonsensical bureaucracy. 

An overview of some of the Rules which need to be revised, or at the very least, that Staff 
take a more Risk Based and Facts and Circumstances view of how these Rules are being 
applied. To be brief, I will touch on some topics which are thematic to the Members and 
which I have seen firsthand, the regulatory overreach and the creation of undue burdens 
on FINRA Member Firms. 

 
 
 
 
Regulation Best Interest (“Reg BI”): 
Reg BI starts out with the idea of being transparent with customers and that broker dealers 
should outline the services that they provide and the costs for the customers. As such, broker 
dealers are required to produce a Customer Relationship Summary (“Form CRS”) to each 
customer and to have Written Supervisory Procedures in place which outline the various points 
of Reg BI. As a part of these Rules, every time a recommendation is made to a customer, the 
registered representative must ascertain that the specific recommendation is in the “Best Interest” 
of the customer.  

  I would suggest that the Rule be modified so that based on the Registered Representatives 

relationship and knowledge of their customer, they do not have to document each 
recommendation as they have a detailed knowledge of their client on file and speak with 
them on an ongoing basis. This concept of having to justify each recommendation has 
brought a tremendous amount unnecessary documentation on both the registered 
representatives and the Firms during audits. If an item has been overlooked, for whatever 
reason, FINRA takes an unnecessary hard stance on the matter. 

  Form CRS should not need to be sent to each customer. The Form CRS should just need 
to be prominently displayed on the Firms website and the Firm should not have to show 
detailed logs of how and when the Form CRS was sent to customers. The delivery and 
documentation of the proof of delivery of Form CRS both initially and upon a material 
change to each customer creates a severe time burden on Firms when customers can 
simply see it on the Firms website. 

Communications with the public: 
Over the years, FINRA has sent out numerous notices relating to how broker dealers 
communicate with the public. The interpretation of these Rules and the way FINRA handles 
them when auditing Member Firms has created an environment where every word that is put 
into an offering document or marketing piece is scrutinized to the point of absurdity. This has 
created an environment where Firms are placing several pages of “disclosures” in a futile 
effort to appease the regulators and not say anything which may be misconstrued as 
“exaggerated” “Promissory” “Hyperbole” or any other potential violation based on the 
subjective reading by an examiner or FINRA enforcement. 

The interpretations of the Communications with the public Rules need to be of a Risk Based 
nature and staff needs to view these communications with a totality of the document and not 
towards a specific phrase, paragraph or notation. 

FINRA New and Continuing Membership Applications: 
• 

Increased regulatory burdens disincentivize entry and innovation in the broker-dealer 
ecosystem, particularly for emerging firms with differentiated business models. 

•  Applications from individuals or firms with past disciplinary history should be assessed 

based on the risk they currently pose, not merely just historical infractions.  

•  A risk-based, tiered review process should be established that considers the nature, 

severity, and recency of any prior regulatory or customer issues. 

•  FINRA must ensure that applicants have a clear, navigable pathway to remediation and 

eventual approval, rather than indefinite penalization or subjective denials. 

•  Transparency and consistency in application decisions are critical to maintaining faith in 
the regulatory system. Applicants should receive detailed explanations and meaningful 

 
opportunities to respond to or appeal adverse findings prior to a denial or withdrawal of 
their application. 

Rather than layering more restrictions and blanket denials, FINRA should rely on a risk-based 
methodology that evaluates applicants based on objective, proportional criteria. 

•  Enforcement and approval decisions should reflect due process principles, fairness, and 
the recognition that reputational damage can have lasting personal and professional 
consequences. 

•  Many proposed restrictions will disproportionately affect small firms and individuals 

seeking a second chance, further consolidating power in the hands of a few large players. 
•  The regulatory framework should promote inclusion, not exclusion, particularly when no 

clear or imminent risk to investors is evident. 

Concerns of enforcement actions to people’s reputations and livelihoods 

•  Regulatory frameworks must not impose lifetime penalties for past misconduct without 

consideration for rehabilitation, context, or mitigating factors. 

•  Public disclosures, sanctions, and enforcement actions can devastate a professional’s 

ability to earn a living, regardless of intent or relative culpability. 

•  The system must reflect a commitment to proportionality, rehabilitation, and fairness, 

especially for first-time or low-risk infractions. 

•  A punitive and inflexible system risks chilling legitimate market participation and fosters 

distrust in regulatory motives. 

•  FINRA must prioritize mechanisms that preserve due process and uphold the 

presumption of competence and integrity unless clear and present risk is demonstrated. 
•  Form U4 and other public disclosures should only be made based on an actual conviction, 

not “have you ever been charged with something”.  

•  FINRA needs to make serious considerations when bringing a rules-based enforcement 
action and make a distinction between a threat to the public and an administrative item 
which should not be made public. 

•  All disclosures should have a timeline in which they can be expunged. Having to defend 
and explain an infraction from more than 10 years ago is not practical and has limited to 
no bearing on their current circumstances.  

FINRA must strike a fair balance between investor protection and the rights of individuals and 
firms to participate in the market. A risk-based, measured regulatory framework is not only 
more just, but also more effective at ensuring long-term market health. I respectfully urge 
FINRA to ease the Rules and adopt a more equitable, nuanced approach to rulemaking and 
enforcement.

Regulatory Notice 25-05,John Comment On Regulatory Notice 25-05,2025-03-31,"RE: Comment on FINRA Regulatory Notice 25-05: Outside Activities Requirements
To Whom It May Concern:
We appreciate the opportunity to comment on FINRA Regulatory Notice 25-05, which proposes a new rule to streamline and reduce unnecessary burdens regarding existing requirements addressing the outside activities of member firms' associated persons. As a FINRA member firm with registered representatives exclusively serving institutional clients, we strongly support FINRA's objective to consolidate Rules 3270 and 3280 into a single framework while maintaining essential investor protections.
Support for Focusing on Investment-Related Activities
We commend FINRA for focusing the proposed rule on investment-related activities, which will eliminate reporting requirements for non-investment-related activities such as coaching sports, driving for a ride-share service, or bartending on weekends. As FINRA correctly notes in the proposal, these activities create ""white noise"" that detracts from meaningful compliance efforts.¹ This targeted approach will allow member firms to dedicate resources to activities presenting higher risk to investors and market integrity.
The FINRA retrospective review data showing that approximately 40% of registered persons submitted OBA notices² underscores the significant compliance burden under the current rules. Narrowing the scope to investment-related activities represents a meaningful step toward more efficient regulation that maintains investor protection while reducing unnecessary administrative burden.
Refinement of ""Investment-Related Activity"" Definition
While we support narrowing the scope to investment-related activities, we believe the proposed definition remains overly broad. The current definition encompasses ""financial assets, including securities, crypto assets, commodities, derivatives, currency, banking, real estate or insurance""³ and could capture activities with minimal potential for conflicts of interest or customer confusion.
For example, under this broad definition, a registered representative who helps manage a family member's rental property, provides basic tax advice, or serves in a volunteer financial capacity for a non-profit organization would need to provide full disclosure and undergo assessment by the member firm, despite minimal investor protection concerns.
We recommend FINRA consider refining the definition to focus more explicitly on activities with genuine potential to create conflicts of interest or customer confusion. This could include establishing clearer parameters for when real estate or insurance activities warrant regulatory scrutiny versus when they present minimal risk.
Risk-Based Framework for Assessment
The proposal appropriately standardizes the assessment criteria for both outside activities and outside securities transactions, requiring members to consider whether the activity: (1) is properly characterized; (2) involves the member's customer(s); (3) will interfere with the person's responsibilities; and (4) will be viewed by customers or the public as part of the member's business.⁴
While these assessment factors are appropriate, we suggest FINRA consider implementing a more explicit risk-based framework that scales requirements based on the actual risk presented. This could include consideration of:
- The nature and sophistication of any customers involved
- The degree of overlap between the outside activity and securities business
- The potential for customer confusion about which entity is responsible for the activity
- The scale and scope of the outside activity relative to the person's role with the member
A more graduated approach would enable members to focus resources on activities presenting genuine investor protection concerns while streamlining oversight for lower-risk activities.
Outside IA Activities Considerations
Regarding FINRA's request for comment on outside IA activities, we recognize the complexity of this issue. The proposal maintains current supervisory and recordkeeping obligations for outside IA activities performed at unaffiliated firms, while excluding those conducted at affiliates.
As FINRA acknowledges in both the 2018 proposal (Regulatory Notice 18-08) and the current notice, these requirements create practical challenges, including ""privacy challenges with a member obtaining account information for customers of an unaffiliated IA through which a member's registered person may be acting in an IA capacity.""⁵ The notice also recognizes that ""these activities are subject to another regulatory regime.""⁶
We believe a more coordinated approach between FINRA and SEC/state securities regulators would better serve investor protection while reducing duplicative oversight. Such coordination could involve clear delineation of supervisory responsibilities and information-sharing protocols that respect client privacy while ensuring appropriate oversight.
At minimum, we encourage FINRA to consider revisiting aspects of the 2018 proposal that would have provided more tailored treatment of outside IA activities, balanced against the legitimate investor protection concerns raised by some commenters to that proposal.
Implementation Considerations
If adopted, we recommend FINRA provide clear implementation guidance and appropriate transition periods for member firms to:
1. Update written supervisory procedures to reflect the new consolidated rule
2. Modify existing reporting systems and documentation
3. Develop assessment protocols that align with the new criteria
4. Train compliance personnel on the new requirements
Additionally, we suggest FINRA develop educational resources to help registered persons understand their obligations under the new rule, particularly regarding which activities require reporting and which are excluded.
Conclusion
We appreciate FINRA's thoughtful approach to streamlining these important requirements. The proposed consolidation of Rules 3270 and 3280 and focus on investment-related activities represent meaningful progress toward more efficient, risk-based regulation.
We believe the refinements suggested above would further enhance the proposal's effectiveness in balancing investor protection with operational efficiency. We welcome the opportunity to discuss these comments further and to participate in any future discussions regarding implementation of the final rule.

Regulatory Notice 25-05,Gary Cutson Comment On Regulatory Notice 25-05,2025-04-28,"Re: FINRA Proposed Rule 3290
Proposed Rule 3290 does not address the transition from Rule 3270 to the proposed rule. Specifically, to what extent and for how long would a previous notification and approval of an outside business activity under Rule 3270 satisfy the requirements of the proposed rule? Previous notifications and approvals under Rule 3270 should continue to be applicable or the new rule creates a new opportunity for new compliance violations where none previously existed. If FINRA intends for new notifications and approvals to be required under Rule 3290, the new rule should be explicit on that point and address the timing for generating such requests and approvals.
Footnote 4 in Regulatory Notice 25-05 states that the most common “buying away” transactions are personal investments in private placements; yet, there is no evaluation of why these transactions or which of these transactions warrant continuation of the existing compliance regime. Under the proposed rule, purchases of private placements continue to require notification and pre-approval even in cases where there is little or no reason regulatory concern about the transaction as in the case where the individual is purchasing the interest on the same basis as other passive investors, e.g., the registered person (1) receives no selling compensation, (2) does not participate in the formation, organization, or management of the entity, (3) does not control the entity, (4) does not sell or promote sales of the entity, and (5) receives only distributions, tax benefits, etc. based on its ownership interest on the same as other similarly situated passive investors. Transactions such as these are unlikely to create regulatory concerns but create substantial compliance obligations and opportunities for unnecessary compliance violations. Like the refereeing of sports games example of outside business activities, these transactions are also “white noise” in securities compliance activities that distract from more important activities and undermine the overall objectives of the compliance function. The proposed rule does not balance any minor regulatory concern for these transactions with the cost of compliance. These purchases should be exempted from the definition of outside securities transactions.
Thank you for your consideration of my comments.

Regulatory Notice 25-05,Harry V Comment On Regulatory Notice 25-05,2025-04-28,"Dear Ms. Mitchell,
I appreciate the opportunity to comment on FINRA’s proposal to streamline the requirements governing outside business activities (OBAs) and private securities transactions (PSTs), as outlined in Regulatory Notice dated April 2025.
I would like to express my support for the proposed exclusions, particularly the exclusion of registered persons’ personal investments in non-securities from the rule’s coverage. This aspect of the Proposal reflects a pragmatic and risk-based approach that appropriately distinguishes between high-risk investment-related activities and routine personal financial decisions that do not pose significant risks to investors or member firms.
Requiring firms to monitor or review personal investments in non-securities—such as real estate purchases for personal use, or private, non-commercial investments—would impose undue compliance burdens without corresponding benefits to investor protection. These activities are typically unrelated to the registered person's role at a member firm and do not reasonably raise concerns of customer confusion or conflicts of interest. By excluding these low-risk activities, the Proposal enables firms to focus resources on higher-risk conduct that may directly impact investor confidence and market integrity.
The Proposal’s thoughtful exclusions, including those for immediate family transactions without selling compensation and activities conducted at affiliates, reflect FINRA’s careful consideration of efficiency, proportionality, and regulatory effectiveness. I commend FINRA for advancing a rule that maintains essential investor protections while reducing unnecessary compliance burdens on member firms and their associated persons.
Thank you for considering these comments, and for your continued efforts to modernize and refine the regulatory framework in a balanced and practical manner.","Dear Ms. Mitchell, I appreciate the opportunity to comment on FINRA’s proposal to streamline the requirements governing outside business activities (OBAs) and private securities transactions (PSTs), as outlined in Regulatory Notice dated April 2025. This aspect of the Proposal reflects a pragmatic and risk-based approach that appropriately distinguishes between high-risk investment-related activities and routine personal financial decisions that do not pose significant risks to investors or member firms.

Dear Ms. Mitchell,
I am an owner of a Registered Investment Advisory firm and a registered representative of an unaffiliated FINRA member firm. I appreciate the opportunity to comment the newly proposed Rule 3290 as set forth in FINRA Regulatory Notice 25-05.  Fundamental to the fiduciary relationship that exists between our firm and our clients is the trust that our clients have that their personal information and objectives will remain confidential. This trust, and the confidentiality of the advisor-client relationship, is critical to our function as fiduciaries and advisors. Advisor-client confidentiality, and specifically the confidentiality of client non-public personal information, is protected under federal law and specifically Regulation SP. State privacy laws also protect the confidential information of investment advisory clients, in some states more stringently that Regulation SP. The proposed Section 3290 provides, at subsection (d)(4) thereof, as follows: For an approved outside securities transaction for selling compensation, the member shall record each transaction on the books and records of the member and supervise the person’s participation in the transaction as if executed on behalf of the member. Regulatory Notice 25-05 interprets “outside securities transactions” to include securities orders placed by advisors on behalf of their clients, thus requiring broker-dealer supervision of these transactions “as if executed on behalf of the member.” Such supervision, under the proposed rule and its incorporated notices, would appear to require extensive information regarding affected advisory clients to be provided to an unaffiliated broker-dealer. Forcing an investment advisor to provide non-public personal information of an advisory client to an unaffiliated broker-dealer violates the privacy rights of the advisory client under federal and state law and undermines the confidentiality that advisory clients expect and deserve in their advisory relationship. Providing unaffiliated broker-dealers access to confidential advisory client information exposes the client’s sensitive financial information to parties who are neither entitled to it nor directly responsible for managing the client’s assets, thereby violating the advisor’s ethical obligations regarding client confidentiality. Further, the proposed Rule would subject affected advisors to additional oversight that doesn’t exist for investment advisory firms that do not have associated persons with FINRA licensure. This uneven layer of oversight is unjustified, as there is no evidence that broker-dealer oversight of investment advisory transactions provides any meaningful protection for advisory clients. Finally, this additional oversight is unsupported anywhere in federal or state law. Based on these considerations, I believe that proposed Rule 3290 as proposed in Regulatory Notice 25-05 should not be adopted.

of their clients, thus requiring broker-dealer supervision of these 
transactions “as if executed on behalf of the member.” Such supervision, under the proposed rule and its incorporated 
notices, would appear to require extensive information regarding affected advisory clients to be provided to an unaffiliated

Forcing an investment advisor to provide non-public personal information of an advisory client to an unaffiliated broker-
dealer violates the privacy rights of the advisory client under federal and state law and undermines the confidentiality that

The rule would inappropriately extend FINRA’s oversight to RIAs who are already regulated by the SEC and state authorities. It would also create a two-tier system—imposing additional compliance burdens on RIAs with FINRA-licensed individuals, while exempting others from the same rules.
Most concerning, the proposed requirement that broker-dealers supervise advisory transactions “as if executed on behalf of the member” could compel RIAs to share non-public client data with unaffiliated firms. This violates both federal (Regulation SP) and State privacy laws, and undermines the confidentiality expected in the advisor-client relationship.
There is no clear benefit to clients from this added oversight, and no statutory basis for such an expansion of FINRA’s authority. It risks creating regulatory confusion, raises serious privacy concerns, and adds unnecessary complexity to fiduciary relationships.
I urge FINRA to reconsider and not adopt Rule 3290 as proposed.

Dear Ms. Mitchell,
I am an owner of a Registered Investment Advisory firm and a registered representative of an unaffiliated FINRA member firm. I appreciate the opportunity to comment on the newly proposed Rule 3290 as set forth in FINRA Regulatory Notice 25-05.
Fundamental to the fiduciary relationship that exists between our firm and our clients is the trust that our clients have that their personal information and objectives will remain confidential. This trust, and the confidentiality of the advisor-client relationship, is critical to our function as fiduciaries and advisors.
Advisor-client confidentiality, and specifically the confidentiality of client non-public personal information, is protected under federal law and specifically Regulation SP. State privacy laws also protect the confidential information of investment advisory clients, in some states more stringently than Regulation SP.
The proposed Section 3290 provides, at subsection (d)(4) thereof, as follows:
For an approved outside securities transaction for selling compensation, the member shall record each transaction on the books and records of the member and supervise the person’s participation in the transaction as if executed on behalf of the member.
Regulatory Notice 25-05 interprets “outside securities transactions” to include securities orders placed by advisors on behalf of their clients, thus requiring broker-dealer supervision of these
transactions “as if executed on behalf of the member"". Such supervision, under the proposed rule and its incorporated notices, would appear to require extensive information regarding affected advisory clients to be provided to an unaffiliated broker-dealer.
Forcing an investment advisor to provide non-public personal information of an advisory client to an unaffiliated broker-dealer violates the privacy rights of the advisory client under federal and state law and undermines the confidentiality that advisory clients expect and deserve in their advisory relationship. Providing unaffiliated broker-dealers access to confidential advisory client information exposes the client’s sensitive financial information to parties who are neither entitled to it nor directly responsible for managing the client’s assets, thereby violating the advisor’s ethical obligations regarding client confidentiality.
Further, the proposed Rule would subject affected advisors to additional oversight that doesn’t exist for investment advisory firms that do not have associated persons with FINRA licensure. This uneven layer of oversight is unjustified, as there is no evidence that broker-dealer oversight of investment advisory transactions provides any meaningful protection for advisory clients.
Finally, this additional oversight is unsupported anywhere in federal or state law.
Based on these considerations, I believe that proposed Rule 3290 as proposed in Regulatory Notice 25-05 should not be adopted.

RE: Comment on Proposed Rule Streamlining Rules 3270 and 3280 (Regulatory Notice XX-XX)
Thursday, May 1, 2025 1:43:02 PM

WARNING: External Sender! Exercise caution with links, attachments and
requests for login information.

Dear Ms. Mitchell:

I write to express my strong opposition to the proposed rule changes that would consolidate
FINRA Rules 3270 and 3280 into a single new rule governing Outside Business Activities
(OBAs) and Private Securities Transactions (PSTs).

While I recognize FINRA’s stated intent to ""streamline and reduce unnecessary burdens,"" the
Proposal, in its current form, fails to deliver on this promise. In fact, the rule as proposed
introduces new complexities, increases the administrative burden on both firms and associated
persons, and may have significant unintended consequences for small firms, independent
advisors, and entrepreneurial professionals within our industry.

1. The Proposal Creates Additional Burden, Not Less

The new rule expands the scope of reportable and reviewable activities beyond what Rules
3270 and 3280 currently require. The requirement for firms to make a subjective ""investment-
related"" determination in virtually all cases, regardless of the nature of the activity, forces
compliance departments to adopt overly conservative stances to avoid regulatory risk. This not
only increases internal compliance costs, but also discourages legitimate and harmless
business activities that have no bearing on the firm or its clients.

2. Overreach Into Personal and Entrepreneurial Activity

The Proposal, as written, encroaches unnecessarily on the personal and entrepreneurial
pursuits of associated persons. Many registered persons engage in benign side activities—
teaching, real estate ventures, or consulting work—that do not involve securities, investors, or
even financial products. Subjecting these activities to firm oversight, recordkeeping, and
potential disapproval is an excessive overreach and potentially violates individual rights to
engage in lawful work outside their registration.

3. A Disincentive for Innovation and Financial Independence

The Proposal disproportionately impacts independent broker-dealers and registered
representatives operating in hybrid or entrepreneurial models. These professionals rely on the
ability to engage in outside ventures to supplement income or build financial independence.
The proposed framework—laden with firm discretion, approval processes, and expanded
recordkeeping—may dissuade firms from allowing such activity altogether, reducing career
flexibility and harming the industry’s competitiveness in attracting top talent.

4. Lack of Evidence That Existing Rules Are Deficient

FINRA has not provided compelling evidence that the current regulatory framework under
Rules 3270 and 3280 is failing to protect investors or that it results in material gaps in
oversight. The retrospective review should have focused on reducing compliance redundancy,
not expanding the reach of regulation under the guise of simplification. The Proposal risks
solving a problem that does not exist while creating new burdens in the process.

5. Unclear Definitions and Guidance Create Compliance Risk

The proposed rule uses terms such as “investment-related,” “compensation,” and “materiality”
in ways that are insufficiently defined and ripe for inconsistent interpretation across firms.
This ambiguity increases legal risk and invites uneven enforcement, further deterring firms
from approving legitimate outside activity.

Conclusion

Rather than reducing regulatory burden, the Proposal amplifies it. It introduces vagueness,
increases compliance costs, threatens personal liberty, and undermines professional autonomy
—particularly for small firms and independent advisors. FINRA should not move forward
with this proposal in its current form. Instead, I urge FINRA to retain the current bifurcated
structure under Rules 3270 and 3280, and, if warranted, issue updated guidance to clarify
expectations without resorting to a sweeping new rule.

This proposed Rule would subject certain independent RIA/IAs to an additional layer of corporate and regulatory oversight that does not exist for other RIA/IAs without FINRA licensure, creating an uneven regulatory environment. Furthermore, it improperly claims jurisdiction over real estate, banking, and insurance businesses, which fall outside FINRA’s charter and are already regulated by other federal and state agencies. This expansion of FINRA’s authority appears to favor large institutions like Merrill Lynch, Morgan Stanley, and UBS, which may seek to disadvantage independent broker-dealers, potentially harming competition and client choice. I urge FINRA to prioritize what is right for clients over the interests of these large firms.
I have read the Comment Letter submitted by Mr. Purcell of PKS Investments and fully agree with his arguments against promulgating Rule 3290. Compliance with client privacy mandates would be nearly impossible, and the conflicting rules and guidance cited by Mr. Purcell foreshadow significant regulatory confusion and turmoil if the Rule is adopted.
Registered Investment Advisory firms are already regulated by the SEC and the states as fiduciaries and are not subject to FINRA jurisdiction. Imposing FINRA rules, which are unrelated to our business, solely on RIA firms with persons registered with a FINRA member serves no justifiable purpose and represents an unwarranted expansion of FINRA’s authority.

Dear Ms. Mitchell,
I am an owner of a Registered Investment Advisory firm and a registered representative of an unaffiliated FINRA member firm. I appreciate the opportunity to comment on the newly proposed Rule 3290 as set forth in FINRA Regulatory Notice 25-05.
Fundamental to the fiduciary relationship that exists between our firm and our clients is the trust that our clients have that their personal information and objectives will remain confidential. This trust, and the confidentiality of the advisor-client relationship, is critical to our function as fiduciaries and advisors.
Advisor-client confidentiality, and specifically the confidentiality of client non-public personal information, is protected under federal law and specifically Regulation SP. State privacy laws also protect the confidential information of investment advisory clients, in some states more stringently than Regulation SP.
The proposed Section 3290 provides, at subsection (d)(4)thereof, as follows:
For an approved outside securities transaction for selling compensation, the member shall record each transaction on the books and records of the member and supervise the person’s participation in the transaction as if executed on behalf of the member.
Regulatory Notice 25-05 interprets “outside securities transactions” to include securities orders placed by advisors on behalf of their clients, thus requiring broker-dealer supervision of these
transactions “as if executed on behalf of the member. ”Such supervision, under the proposed rule and its incorporated notices, would appear to require extensive information regarding affected advisory clients to be provided to an unaffiliated broker-dealer.
Forcing an investment advisor to provide non-public personal information of an advisory client to an unaffiliated broker-dealer violates the privacy rights of the advisory client under federal and state law and undermines the confidentiality that advisory clients expect and deserve in their advisory relationship. Providing unaffiliated broker-dealers access to confidential advisory client information exposes the client’s sensitive financial information to parties who are neither entitled to it nor directly responsible for managing the client’s assets, thereby violating the advisor’s ethical obligations regarding client confidentiality.
Further, the proposed Rule would subject affected advisors to additional oversight that doesn’t exist for investment advisory firms that do not have associated persons with FINRA licensure. This uneven layer of oversight is unjustified, as there is no evidence that broker-dealer oversight of investment advisory transactions provides any meaningful protection for advisory clients.
Finally, this additional oversight is unsupported anywhere in federal or state law.
Based on these considerations, I believe that proposed Rule 3290 as proposed in Regulatory Notice 25-05 should not be adopted.
Thank you.","The proposed Section 3290 provides, at subsection (d)(4)thereof, as follows: For an approved outside securities transaction for selling compensation, the member shall record each transaction on the books and records of the member and supervise the person’s participation in the transaction as if executed on behalf of the member.

Dear Ms. Mitchell,
As a fully licensed financial professional and manager with Series 7, 66, 9, 10, and 31 registrations, I am writing to express strong opposition to Proposed Rule 3290 under FINRA Regulatory Notice 25-05. While I respect FINRA’s mission to ensure ethical conduct in our industry, this proposed rule would impose disproportionate restrictions on personal freedom, privacy, and professional autonomy—particularly regarding investments in digital assets.
The requirement that financial advisors obtain written broker-dealer approval before investing in any crypto asset—including extending this rule to spouses, partners, and household members—is overly invasive. It imposes a level of surveillance into personal financial choices that is not only unnecessary, but potentially damaging to the trust and independence we work so hard to maintain in our households and professional environments.
Additionally, this rule introduces severe operational challenges. Broker-dealers are not uniformly equipped to evaluate or manage personal crypto investment requests in real time. Unlike traditional securities, the digital asset market operates 24/7, with price volatility and liquidity windows that require timely, agile decision-making. By mandating prior written approval, the proposed rule could force financial professionals to miss critical entry or exit points—creating real financial risk through delay. In effect, it penalizes licensed professionals for responsibly participating in an emerging asset class.
From a risk-management standpoint, the rule conflates personal investment activity with outside business activity, which are two distinct matters. Advisors investing their own post-tax capital in widely available, non-proprietary assets for educational or long-term purposes should not be subject to pre-clearance requirements designed for conflict-prone activities.
In summary, while transparency is vital, this proposal overreaches. It compromises personal and familial privacy, disrupts firm operations, and introduces timing risk that is uniquely problematic in a 24/7 real-time market like crypto. I strongly urge FINRA to revise or reconsider this rule in favor of a more balanced, targeted approach that addresses legitimate regulatory concerns without inhibiting the financial freedom or market access of its own members.
Thank you for your time and consideration during this important comment period.
Sincerely,

While I fully support FINRA’s mission to protect investors, this proposal overreaches its scope and places an excessive burden on licensed professionals. Under the proposed rule, representatives holding a FINRA license would be required to obtain prior written approval from their broker-dealer before engaging in a broad range of personal financial activities — including the purchase of cryptocurrency, securities, commodities, real estate, insurance, and banking products. Extending this requirement to spouses, partners, and household members is not only intrusive, but it also sets a concerning precedent. Expecting written approval for routine personal decisions — such as purchasing a home, opening a savings account, or buying life insurance — does nothing to enhance investor protection. Instead, it compromises personal autonomy and burdens both advisors and broker-dealers with unnecessary administrative friction. The rule’s broad definition of “investment-related activity” risks stifling innovation and diversity in financial strategies. It could push many financial professionals to abandon their FINRA licenses in favor of operating under SEC jurisdiction — ultimately weakening the value and relevance of FINRA oversight. I urge FINRA to withdraw or significantly revise this proposal.

Re: Request for Comment on Regulatory Notice 25-05 
Dear Ms. Mitchell, 

I am an owner of a Registered Investment Advisory firm and a registered representative of an 
unaffiliated FINRA member firm.  I appreciate the opportunity to comment on the newly 
proposed Rule 3290 as set forth in FINRA Regulatory Notice 25-05. 

Fundamental to the fiduciary relationship that exists between our firm and our clients is the trust 
that our clients have that their personal information and objectives will remain confidential.  This 
trust, and the confidentiality of the advisor-client relationship, is critical to our function as 
fiduciaries and advisors. 

Advisor-client confidentiality, and specifically the confidentiality of client non-public personal 
information, is protected under federal law and specifically Regulation SP.  State privacy laws 
also protect the confidential information of investment advisory clients, in some states more 
stringently than Regulation SP. 

The proposed Section 3290 provides, at subsection (d)(4) thereof, as follows: 

For an approved outside securities transaction for selling compensation, the 
member shall record each transaction on the books and records of the member and 
supervise the person’s participation in the transaction as if executed on behalf of 
the member.

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Regulatory Notice 25-05 interprets “outside securities transactions” to include securities 
orders placed by advisors on behalf of their clients, thus requiring broker-dealer supervision 
of these 
transactions “as if executed on behalf of the member.”  Such supervision, under the proposed 
rule and its incorporated notices, would appear to require extensive information regarding 
affected advisory clients to be provided to an unaffiliated broker-dealer. 

Forcing an investment advisor to provide non-public personal information of an advisory 
client to an unaffiliated broker-dealer violates the privacy rights of the advisory client under 
federal  and state law and  undermines the confidentiality that advisory clients expect and 
deserve in their advisory relationship. Providing unaffiliated broker-dealers access to 
confidential advisory client information exposes the client’s sensitive financial information to 
parties who are neither entitled to it nor directly responsible for managing the client’s assets, 
thereby violating the advisor’s ethical obligations regarding client confidentiality. 

Further, the proposed Rule would subject affected advisors to additional oversight that doesn’t 
exist for investment advisory firms that do not have associated persons with FINRA licensure. 
This uneven layer of oversight is unjustified, as there is no evidence that broker-dealer 
oversight of investment advisory transactions provides any meaningful protection for advisory 
clients. 
Finally, this additional oversight is unsupported anywhere in federal or state law. 

Based on these considerations, I believe that proposed Rule 3290 as proposed in Regulatory 
Notice 25-05 should not be adopted.

Sincerely,

Re: Request for Comment on Regulatory Notice 25-05
Dear Ms. Mitchell,
I am an owner of a Registered Investment Advisory firm and a registered representative of an unaffiliated FINRA member firm. I appreciate the opportunity to comment on the newly proposed Rule 3290 as set forth in FINRA Regulatory Notice 25-05.
Fundamental to the fiduciary relationship that exists between our firm and our clients is the trust that our clients have that their personal information and objectives will remain confidential. This trust, and the confidentiality of the advisor-client relationship, is critical to our function as fiduciaries and advisors.
Advisor-client confidentiality, and specifically the confidentiality of client non-public personal information, is protected under federal law and specifically Regulation SP. State privacy laws also protect the confidential information of investment advisory clients, in some states more stringently than Regulation SP.
The proposed Section 3290 provides, at subsection (d)(4) thereof, as follows:
For an approved outside securities transaction for selling compensation, the member shall record each transaction on the books and records of the member and supervise the person’s participation in the transaction as if executed on behalf of the member.
Regulatory Notice 25-05 interprets “outside securities transactions” to include securities orders placed by advisors on behalf of their clients, thus requiring broker-dealer supervision of these
transactions “as if executed on behalf of the member.” Such supervision, under the proposed rule and its incorporated notices, would appear to require extensive information regarding affected advisory clients to be provided to an unaffiliated broker-dealer.
Forcing an investment advisor to provide non-public personal information of an advisory client to an unaffiliated broker-dealer violates the privacy rights of the advisory client under federal and state law and undermines the confidentiality that advisory clients expect and deserve in their advisory relationship.

Re:    FINRA Regulatory Notice 25-05 – Proposed New Rule 
Governing Outside Business Activities and Private Securities Transactions 

Dear Ms. Mitchell: 

I write on behalf of the Public Investors Advocate Bar Association (“PIABA”), an international 
bar  association  comprised  of  attorneys  who  represent  investors  in  securities  arbitration  and 
litigation. Since its formation in 1990, PIABA has promoted the interests of the public investor in 
all  securities  and  commodities  arbitration  forums,  while  also  advocating  for  public  education 
regarding investment fraud and industry misconduct. Our members and their clients have a strong 
interest  in  rules  promulgated  by  the  Financial  Industry  Regulatory  Authority  (hereinafter 
“FINRA”) related to investor protection.   

FINRA Regulatory Notice 25-05 seeks comments concerning reforms to FINRA Rules 3270 and 
3280. While FINRA has proposed retaining most aspects of the supervisory requirements in these 
rules, there are several exceptions and modifications which PIABA believes increases risk for the 
investing public.  FINRA proposes to exempt member firms from supervising: 

• 

Investment  related  activities  at  member  affiliates  including  IAs,  banks,  and  insurance 
companies;  

•  Non-investment related work and outside business activities; and 
•  Personal investments in non-securities; 

PIABA’s  position  is  that  FINRA’s  proposed  rule  changes  would  result  in  member  firms 
implementing  supervisory  procedures  that  would  be  deemed  unreasonable  under  the  Exchange 
Act, subject members to substantial reputational and litigation risk, and increase investor harm and 
exploitation  by  representatives  who  would  exploit  the  rules.  Further,  PIABA  believes  that  the 
proposed rule change would not result in meaningful differences in supervisory practices while 
potentially increasing confusion.  Consequently, PIABA strongly disfavors the implementation of 
this rule.

FINRA’s supervisory rules concerning outside business activities (“OBAs”) and private securities 
transactions (a/k/a “selling away”) have serious consequences for investors and members alike.  
Despite the existing rules, selling away remains a top concern.  Each year FINRA brokers engage 
in dozens of fraudulent schemes costing investors their irreplaceable life savings.1  For over 30 
years the NASD and now FINRA have emphasized that private securities transactions “presents 
serious, regulatory concerns.”  Notice To Members (“NTM”) 85-84.  The SEC has stated that: 

[FINRA]  Conduct  Rule  3040  [prohibiting  “selling  away”]  is 
designed not only to protect investors from unsupervised sales, but 
also to protect securities firms from liability and loss resulting from 
such  sales.  Such  misconduct  deprives  investors  of  a  firm’s 
oversight, due diligence, and supervision, protections investors have 
a right to expect. 

In re Siegel, 2008 SEC LEXIS 2459 at *36 (Oct. 2, 2008), aff'd Siegel v. SEC, 592 F.3d 147, 156 
(D.C. Cir. 2010) (citation omitted).   

Selling away is the practice of a registered representative who has a license to legally sell securities 
to engage in the unlicensed sale of securities.  Those who do so act as brokers within the meaning 
of Section 3(a)(4) of the Exchange Act [15 U.S.C. §78c(4)] and are not registered with the SEC in 
accordance  with  Section  15(b)  of  the  Exchange  Act  [15  U.S.C.  §  78o(b)].    Firms  that  fail  to 
supervise their registered representatives to reasonably detect and prevent such activities run the 
risk of being sanctioned by the SEC because firms are responsible for preventing their registered 
representatives from violating the securities laws.  

Exchange Act Section 15(b)(4)(E) provides that the SEC can sanction or revoke the registration of 
any member firm “if it finds… that such broker or dealer… has willfully aided, abetted, counseled, 
commanded, induced, or procured the violation by any person of any provision of the Securities 
Act  of  1933,  the  Investment  Advisers  Act  of  1940,  the  Investment  Company  Act  of  1940,  the 
Commodity Exchange Act, [the Securities Exchange Act of 1934], the rules or regulations under 
any  of  such  statutes,  or  the  rules  of  the  Municipal  Securities  Rulemaking  Board,  or  has  failed 
reasonably to supervise, with a view to preventing violations of the provisions of such statutes, 
rules, and regulations, another person who commits such a violation, if such other person is 
subject to his supervision.”  15 U.S.C. § 78o(b)(4)(E) (emphasis added). 

1 For the past 15 years the sales of unregistered securities by unlicensed salesman have been noted 
as  one  of  the  top  violations  that  The  North  American  Securities  Administrators  Association 
(“NASAA”)  reports  each  year.    See  NASAA  2024  Enforcement  Report  (available  at: 
https://www.nasaa.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/FINAL_2024-Enforcement-Report.pdf) 
(“The  top  three  violations  charged  were  the  offer  or  sale  of  securities/investment  advice  by 
unlicensed  parties  (394  actions),  the  offer  or  sale  of  unregistered  securities  (386  actions)...”); 
'Selling away' again a concern for regulators, InvestmentNews, (Oct. 14, 2011) (available at: 
https://www.investmentnews.com/broker-dealers/selling-away-again-a-concern-for-
regulators/39244#:~:text=Stockbrokers%20who%20sell%20products%20that,concern%20for%2
0state%20securities%20regulators)  (NASAA  reported  that  in  2011  there  were  54  enforcement 
actions involving selling away.) 

2 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The  Exchange  Act  was  written  with  the  understanding  that  those  who  commit  securities  fraud 
might abuse their securities registration and association with licensed firms to perpetrate fraud.  
The  Exchange  Act  requires  broker-dealers  to  supervise  all  of  a  representative’s  investment 
activities, no matter how the activity is executed, providing a prophylactic approach to supervision 
designed to prevent violations of the securities laws.  Registration by a representative under the 
Investment Advisor Act or any other securities act in no way lessens a broker-dealers responsibility 
to  reasonably  supervise  the  activity  of  the  representative  to  prevent  violations  of  the  securities 
laws. 2  In sum, The Exchange Act has no provision allowing for the delegation of supervision to 
another securities statute. 

FINRA and the SEC have both reinforced members’ need to comply with the requirements of the 
Exchange Act.  See Staff Legal Bulletin No. 17: Remote Office Supervision, SEC Rel. No. SLB-
3A(CF),  2004  WL  5698359  (Mar.  19,  2004)  (“Sections  15(b)(4)(E)1  and  15(b)(6)(A)  2  of  the 
Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (Exchange Act) authorize the Commission to impose sanctions 
on a firm or any person that fails to reasonably supervise a person subject to their supervision that 
commits a violation of the federal securities laws.”).  In a joint notice FINRA and the SEC stated: 

The  responsibility  of  broker-dealers  to  supervise  their  associated 
persons  is  a  critical  component  of  the  federal  regulatory  scheme. 
Sections 15(b)(4)(E) and 15(b)(6)(A) of the Exchange Act authorize 
the Commission to impose sanctions on a firm or any person that 
fails  to  reasonably  supervise  someone  that  is  subject  to  the 
supervision of such firm or person who violates the federal securities 
laws. In order to defend such a charge, a broker-dealer could show 
that it has established procedures that would reasonably be expected 
to  prevent  and  detect  a  violation  by  such  other  person,  and  has  a 
system  for  applying  such  procedures  that  has  been  effectively 
implemented. Such a system must be designed in such a way that it 
could  reasonably  be  expected  to  prevent  and  detect,  insofar  as 
practicable, securities law violations. 

2 FINRA also incorrectly states in its Proposal that the “current rules and the Proposal impose a 
regulatory burden for members that is not matched by equivalent requirements in the IA industry.” 
Pg. 10.  This is not true as the duty is exactly the same on the IA side.  IA’s have the same duty to 
reasonably supervise their representatives to prevent them from violating the Exchange Act and 
other  securities  statutes.    See  15  U.S.  Code  §  80b-3(e)(6)  SEC  may  sanction  any  IA  that  “has 
willfully aided, abetted, counseled, commanded, induced, or procured the violation by any other 
person  of  any  provision  of  the  Securities  Act  of  1933  [15  U.S.C.  77a  et  seq.],  the  Securities 
Exchange Act of 1934 [15 U.S.C. 78a et seq.], subchapter I of this chapter, this subchapter, the 
Commodity Exchange Act [7 U.S.C. 1 et seq.], the rules or regulations under any of such statutes, 
or the rules of the Municipal Securities Rulemaking Board, or has failed reasonably to supervise, 
with  a  view  to  preventing  violations  of  the  provisions  of  such  statutes,  rules  and  regulations, 
another person who commits such a violation, if such other person is subject to his supervision.”

National Examination Risk Alert: By the Office of Compliance Inspections and Examinations in 
cooperation with the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority, Vol. 1, Iss. 2, pg. 4 (Nov. 30, 2011).  
Both  Staff  Legal  Bulletin  No.  17  and  National  Examination  Risk  Alert  focused  on  the  need  to 
supervise OBAs and selling away activity to prevent violations of the Exchange Act. 

I. 

Associated Person’s Non-BD Activity On Behalf of a Member Or its Affiliate 

FINRA’s proposal excludes from a Member’s supervisory responsibility an associated person’s 
non-BD activity conducted on behalf of a member or its affiliate.  FINRA provides examples as 
being  IA  activity  at  a  dually  registered  firm  and  insurance  or  banking  activity  conducted  at  an 
affiliate.  FINRA states that the justification for the exclusion for activity conducted at an affiliate 
recognizes members’ ability to implement meaningful controls across business lines. 

PIABA’s  position  is  that  FINRA  firms  must  supervise  the  activities  of  their  registered 
representatives’  investment  related  activities  no  matter  where  such  activities  occur  in  order  to 
comply  with  the  Exchange  Act’s  requirements.    The  Exchange  Act  provides  no  exemption  for 
reasonable supervision based on the fact that the investment activity takes place through an affiliate 
of a broker-dealer.  As such, FINRA’s proposal would leave firms potentially vulnerable to failure 
to supervise claims by the SEC and other regulators. 

Further,  FINRA’s  statements  are  inconsistent.    On  the  one  hand,  FINRA  claims  that  members 
implement  meaningful  controls  across  business  lines.    On  the  other  hand,  FINRA  claims  that 
activity performed on behalf of a dually registered firm is not considered activity performed away 
from the member as if there is no corporate distinction between a broker-dealer and an investment 
advisor if they are affiliates.  Any activity performed away from a FINRA member cannot be the 
member’s activity and must be supervised as if it was conduct through the member. 

Finally,  FINRA  does  not  even  identify  any  regulatory  burden  that  it  is  alleviating  through  its 
proposed  rule  change.    As  noted,  the  “vast  majority  of  member  affiliates  are  under  common 
control;  thus,  these  affiliates  may  share  compliance  resources  and  systems.”    Proposal,  pg.  10.  
Those  compliance  resources  would  include  common  compliance  officers,  supervisors,  unified 
books  and  records,  email  systems,  examination  cycles,  clearing  firms,  etc.    Accordingly,  the 
Proposal not only fails to protect member firms against failure to supervise claims, but is a solution 
in search of a problem that does not exist. 

II. 

Non-Investment Related Work and Outside Business Activities 

FINRA’s Proposal’s limits the scope of OBAs to those that are investment related and excludes 
the  need  to  report  non-investment  related  OBAs.    FINRA  claims  that  non-investment  related 
activities  are  common  and  varied  and  that  removing  reporting  requirements  for  such  activities 
would relieve both registered persons and members from costs associated reporting and review of 
these  activities.    FINRA  concludes  that  “there  is  likely  little  risk  that  noninvestment-related 
activities could be perceived by the investing public as part of the member’s business.” Pg. 9. 

4 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
PIABA’s  position  is  that  FINRA  firms  must  supervise  the  OBAs  of  their  registered 
representatives’ in order to detect and prevent violations of the securities laws in compliance with 
the Exchange Act’s requirements.   

The SEC has stated that all OBAs should be assessed for potential risks.   

a  firm  should  be  alert  to  and  investigate  “red  flags”  indicating 
possible  undisclosed  outside  business  activities  and  assess  all 
outside business activities by a representative, whether or not related 
to the securities business. The Commission has recognized that there 
is a risk that representatives will use outside business activities to 
carry out or conceal securities law violations. 

Staff Legal Bulletin No. 17. 

In the National Examination Risk Alert, FINRA and the SEC stated that OBAs should be inspected 
during branch examinations to confirm “that the scope of outside business activities of registered 
branch  office  personnel  conform  to  those  activities  authorized  by  the  firm[,]  is  an  important 
component  of  the  branch  office  inspection,  and  addresses  a  risk  that  may  be  more  difficult  to 
monitor.” pg. 3. 

PIABA  members’  experience  has  been  that  registered  representatives  use  a  variety  of  OBA 
businesses  to  solicit  investors  for  financing.    Such  schemes  include  all  manner  of  businesses 
including real estate, restaurants, health care related facilities, equipment, or medications, leasing 
or equipment companies, film companies, software related companies, and other private equity 
ventures.  Arguably none of the foregoing types of businesses that result in common selling away 
activity and investor harm would be classified as investment-related activity under the Proposed 
FINRA Rule 3290(f)(2).   

In  addition,  FINRA’s  Proposal  appears  to  place  the  registered  representative  in  charge  of 
determining what an “investment-related activity outside the scope of such person’s relationship 
with the member that is not in connection with a securities transaction” is.  An outside investment-
related activity that is not a securities transaction has not been previously defined by any regulator 
or securities statute.  Due to the confusing nature of the Proposal’s application most firms are likely 
to continue to document all OBAs and require their registered representatives to bring all OBAs 
to the firm’s attention for review.  It is likely firms would continue to make determinations as to 
whether or not the disclosed OBA would have to be reported on the representatives Form U4 or 
be internally classified and monitored as an outside non-investment related activity. 

Proposed Rule 3290(a) also requires firms to monitor for a “material change to the outside activity” 
that would render the activity either an outside investment-related activity that is not a securities 
transaction or an outside investment-related activity that is a securities transaction (a/k/a private 
securities transaction).  Firms would have to have documentation of even non-investment related 
activity in order to keep track of disclosed activity that may be subject to the rule’s material change 
provision.   

5 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
FINRA’s proposed changes to disclosures of OBAs does little to either protect investors or provide 
firms  and  registered  representatives  with  clarity  while  failing  to  provide  any  meaningful 
supervisory  relief.    Moreover,  FINRA  does  not  identify  any  significant  regulatory  burden  on 
registered representatives and firms to disclose activities such as refereeing sports games or being 
an Uber driver. 

III. 

PIABA’s Comments on Dually Registered Representatives with Unaffiliated RIAs 

As PIABA noted with respect to FINRA Regulatory Notice 18-08 a rule change with respect to 
dually  registered  unaffiliated  IAs  would  result  in  member  firms  implementing  supervisory 
procedures  that  would  be  deemed  unreasonable  under  the  Exchange  Act,  subject  members  to 
substantial  reputational  and  litigation  risk,  and  increase  investor  harm  and  exploitation  by 
representatives  who  would  exploit  the  rules.  PIABA  continues  to  strongly  disfavor  the 
implementation of rules that expose members and public to harm and regulatory sanctions.  

Registration by a representative under the Investment Advisor Act or any other securities act in no 
way  lessens  a  broker-dealers  responsibility  to  reasonably  supervise  the  activity  of  the 
representative  to  prevent  violations  of  the  securities  laws  under  Sections  15(b)(4)(E)  and 
15(b)(6)(A) of the Exchange Act.  Neither the current Proposal nor NTM 18-08 addressed how 
such rule proposals would change member’s supervisory responsibilities under Exchange Act’s 
explicit supervisory requirements.   

The current FINRA Rules 3270 and 3280 and NTMs 91-32, 94-44, and 96-333 are designed to 
reasonably achieve compliance with a member’s supervisory obligations under the Exchange Act.  
Repealing existing guidance and rules will endanger member firms and remove guidance essential 
for firms to understand their supervisory obligations under Federal law.  No FINRA study or notice 
has provided evidence or justification that outside businesses or activities engaged in by dually 
registered representatives no longer pose a risk that such activities would not be used to conceal 
securities laws violations.  Failing to supervise disclosed investment activities or those discovered 
by  “red  flags”  would  subject  member  firms  to  charges  of  failing  to  supervise  and  increase  the 
likelihood of investor harm. 

It  has  been  the  experience  of  PIABA  members  that  registered  representatives  establish  solo  or 
small  IA  firms  and  use  OBAs  in  order  to  avoid  member  supervision  to  the  harm  of  investors.  
Below  are  just  some  examples  of  investors  losing  hundreds  of  millions  in  investment  frauds 
perpetrated  by  registered  representatives  through  third-party  IAs  established  by  the  registered 
representative: 

3 NASD NTM 91–32 (the NASD states that Rule 3040 “should apply to all investment advisory 
activities” and “to conclude otherwise would permit registered persons to participate in securities 
transactions outside the scope of the oversight and supervision of the employer member and of a 
self-regulatory organization to the potential detriment of customers.”

Securities Violation Details 
FINRA  panel  found  that  Churchville’s  member  firm  failed  to 
supervise Churchville’s private equity fraud conducted through his 
IA.  The award was later confirmed in court.  Churchville’s fraud 
caused  $27  million  in  losses  to  more  than  220  victims  and  was 
subject to an SEC action and criminal charges. 
SEC found that advisor Adam E. Nugent defrauded clients to invest 
in Agronomic Capital, LP.  In addition, to Agronomic, Mr. Nugent 
also engaged in other PSTs including the Auto Loan Fund LLC, 
Union  Commercial  Service  Group,  Candera  Capital  LLC, 
Mountain Bike, and in one instance a personal loan to finance Mr. 
Nugent’s business endeavors.  Mr. Nugent was dually registered as 
an IA through Foresight Wealth Management (“FWM”) while also 
being registered as a broker.  Investors brought a claim against the 
broker-dealer alleging over $13 million in investor losses. 
From  September  2016  through  2024  the  State  of  Massachusetts 
found  that  PKS  failed  to  have  in  place  written  policies  and 
procedures  to  review  the  investment  advisory  transactions  of  its 
dually  registered  advisors  (“DRAs”)  in  2017  and  2018  for 
transactions  that  occurred  in  accounts  managed  solely  by 
unaffiliated registered investment advisers.  The unaffiliated RIA 
engaged  in  leveraged  ETF  transactions  that  were  not  supervised 
and PKS never flagged any of the transactions for review.   
PKS  paid  a  $1.6  million  settlement  with  50  clients  for  failing  to 
supervise Brendan Shaw.  Mr. Shaw defrauded the Claimants by 
trading  their  accounts  through  his  RIA  firm,  Thomsen  Financial 
Advisors  LLC  (“TFA”).      Mr.  Shaw  and  his  business  partner 
engaged  in  reckless  options  trading  that  caused  his  clients 
tremendous losses. 
Some victims have alleged that Mustaphalli’s member firm failed 
to supervise a hedge fund operated through his IA.  Mustaphalli’s 
fraud caused $10 million in losses to 58 victims and was subject of 
an action by the New York Attorney General’s office. 
Some  victims  have  alleged  that  Burnell’s  member  firm  failed  to 
supervise  extraordinarily  risky  leveraged  ETF  trades  conducted 
through Burnell’s IA.  Burnell’s fraud caused about 30 investors 
more than $2 million. 
Some  victims  have  alleged  that  Steele’s  member  firm  failed  to 
supervise private placement sales conducted through Steele’s IA.  
Steele’s sales caused approximately 100 investors more than $7.5 
million in losses 

Vetea Ribet (CRD#: 4823379)  Mr. Ribet was an IA through Westside Investment Management’s 
(“WIM”).    Mr.  Ribet  recommended  that  an  investor  engage  in  a 
speculative options investment strategy involving a bear call spread 
that caused over $2 million in losses.  Correspondence showed that 
Mr. Ribet represented the speculative strategy to as conservative.

In addition, FINRA and members that advocate for this rule change fail to provide a realistic vision 
of how such a rule could be realistically implemented.  FINRA members would still be required 
to supervise emails, gather information about IA OBAs, and inspect branch locations for ‘red flags’ 
for violations of the securities laws.  A firm with red flags of Ponzi scheme activities or other fraud 
would  not  be  able  to  turn  a  blind  eye  and  continue  to  employ  that  individual  just  because  the 
broker-dealer believed the activity was only occurring at an IA. 

Moreover, such schemes would most likely be conducted as an unregistered broker-dealer and not 
as an IA creating an enormous blind spot in members’ ability to supervise violations not of the 
Investment Advisors Act but of the Exchange Act.  If the IA sells a private venture to a client 
without having the asset custodied in an advisory account that charged an advisory fee the broker-
dealer  would  not  be  able  to  show  that  the  activity  was  IA  activity  as  opposed  to  unregistered 
broker-dealer activity.  If we change the above fact pattern so that Ponzi scheme victims never 
sign opening account forms with the IA and no accounts are established at the IA firm a member 
firm would also be unable to show that the scheme was conducted through the IA.  FINRA should 
not propose a private securities transaction rule where a fraudster’s unsupervised paperwork lapses 
have the effect of altering a member’s supervisory responsibilities in the first instance.  As repeated 
throughout  this  response  a  member’s  supervisory  responsibilities  stem  from  the  Exchange  Act 
which does not permit broker-dealers to claim supervisory loopholes based on dual registration. 

The  foregoing  example  is  not  a  made  up  example  but  one  that  continues  to  occur  in  scenarios 
PIABA members encounter.  For example, IA Adam Nugent ran several private equity funds.  Mr. 
Nugent was dually registered as an IA through Foresight Wealth Management (“FWM”) while 
also  being  registered  as  a  broker.    The  broker-dealer  argued  in  federal  court  that  the  private 
securities transactions occurred through FWM.  However, these investments were never custodied 
in a FWM account nor was any evidence provided that FWM charged an advisory fee on these 
investments.  A federal judge found that the “Agronomic investment was not made through the 
[investor’s] accounts with Foresight.”  Purshe Kaplan Sterling Invs., Inc. v. Thomsen, No. 2:24-
CV-00002-JNP, 2024 WL 1307268, at *9 (D. Utah Mar. 26, 2024).  Accordingly, Mr. Nugent was 
engaged in unlicensed broker-dealer while being registered with a broker-dealer.  In this example 
we can see how an IA can conceal violations of the Exchange Act within an IA firm.  The only 
way to comply with the Exchange Act’s requirements to protect member firms and the investing 
public is to supervise securities activities.  

In  addition,  any  such  rule  proposal  would  have  to  be  harmonized  with  multiple  NTMs  as  far 
reaching as suitability, record keeping, and branch audits.  If the proposed rule were implemented 
FINRA would have to spend years clarifying whether or not dozens of previously issued NTMs 
were intended to be modified by the proposed rule or how firms would be expected to comply with 
prior guidance. 

For example, a recommendation to a registered representative’s client to sell all of their assets at a 
member firm to invest entirely in private placements at the registered representative’s IA would 
be a recommendation or investment strategy that the registered representative’s member would 
have to supervise under RN 12-25.  See pg. 6.  Under the proposed rule, registered representatives 
would  be  incentivized  to  move  assets  from  brokerage  accounts  to  their  IA  in  order  to  make 

8 

 
 
 
 
 
 
recommendations in products and services that their member firm would not approve.  Yet, the 
movement of such assets would be a transaction that would still need to be supervised under prior 
guidance. 

Other  aspects  of  previous  suitability  guidance  are  also  implicated.    FINRA  has  stated  that  the 
suitability rule “requires a broker to seek to obtain and analyze a customer’s other investments. 
The  rule  thus  explicitly  permits  a  suitability  analysis  to  be  performed  within  the  context  of  a 
customer’s other investments.” RN 12-25, pg. 13.  A FINRA member would have to have access 
to  the  IA’s  investments  in  order  to  ensure  that  member  firms  were  acting  in  their  client’s  best 
interests.   

Likewise, member firms are obligated under Rule 17a-4 to record and supervise communications 
of their registered representatives related to firm business.  See SEC Rel. No. 34-38245 (Jan. 31, 
1997).    Any  potential  rule  would  not  clarify  FINRA’s  past  guidance  on  member  firm’s 
requirements to record correspondence and investigate “red flag” communications through OBAs, 
through affiliated firms or third-party IAs that share joint clients with members and other scenarios.  
It  is  unlikely  that  FINRA  would  be  able  to  devise  a  correspondence  supervisory  protocol  that 
would  achieve  compliance  with  Rule  17a-4  without  requiring  firms  to  monitor  and  record  all 
investment-related emails. 

Finally, any such proposed rule would clearly contradict prior SEC guidance and fails to clarify 
whether or not FINRA is proposing to limit the scope of branch audits and its joint guidance with 
the SEC under RN 11-54.   

FINRA  and  member  firms  have  provided  weak  justifications  for  providing  guidance  that  is 
contrary  to  the  Exchange  Act’s  Section  15(b)(4)(E)  supervisory  requirements.    Common 
arguments  include  that  the  SEC  overseas  RIAs,  privacy  concerns,  and  that  RIAs  are  held  to  a 
fiduciary standard.  None of these reasons provide much cause for concern.   

The  fact  that  the  SEC  overseas  RIAs  is  irrelevant.    The  SEC  also  overseas  broker-dealers,  yet 
FINRA has yet to propose that firms should stop supervising their own representatives.  Moreover, 
the SEC has repeatedly held that firm supervision is the first line of defense to prevent violations 
of the securities laws.4    

Privacy  concerns  are  routinely  taken  care  of  through  disclosure  of  how  investor  information  is 
shared and FINRA has never provided examples of firms’ being sanctioned for supervising their 
representatives due to privacy law violations.   

4 Richard Y. Roberts, SEC Commissioner, ""The Role of Compliance Personnel"" (Apr. 7, 1995) 
(available at: 
https://www.sec.gov/news/speech/speecharchive/1995/spch030.txt#:~:text=Section%2015(b)(4)(
E)%20authorizes%20the%20Commission%20to%20impose,is%20subject%20to%20his%20sup

role of inhouse compliance personnel as being critical to the maintenance of the integrity of our 
securities markets.  You are the first line of defense against fraud and sales practice abuse…”)

Finally,  there  are  many  situations  where  fiduciary  duties  are  imposed  on  broker-dealers  and  a 
number of states apply a general fiduciary duty on broker-dealers.  In addition, the SEC has stated 
that  “Regulation  Best  Interest  (“Reg  BI”)  for  broker-dealers  and  the  fiduciary  standard  for 
investment advisers under the Investment Advisers Act (the “IA fiduciary standard”) are drawn 
from key fiduciary principles that include an obligation to act in the retail investor’s best interest 
and not to place their own interests ahead of the investor’s interest.”5  “Both Reg BI and the IA 
fiduciary standard require your account recommendations to be in the retail investor’s best interest 
and require you not to place your or your firm’s interests ahead of the retail investor’s interest.”  
Id.  Accordingly, the standard of care is more similar than dissimilar.   

In addition, as FINRA itself has noted for RIAs affiliated with a broker-dealer, the “vast majority 
of  member  affiliates  are  under  common  control;  thus,  these  affiliates  may  share  compliance 
resources and systems.”  Proposal, pg. 10.  It cannot be that the rules governing RIAs and broker-
dealers  are  so  vastly  different  that  the  same  compliance  and  systems  could  be  used  by  RIAs 
affiliated with broker-dealers and at the same time so different as to make it impossible to supervise 
effectively.     

The current rules and guidance were issued in order to protect member firms from litigation risk 
and investors from unsupervised investment activity.  Rule changes under consideration appear 
aimed at ensuring that members will be exposed to increased litigation and investors to increased 
potential harm.   

In sum, PIABA is concerned that FINRA continues to entertain rule proposals that will lead to 
industry  non-compliance  with  the  supervisory  requirements  of  the  Exchange  Act  and  provide 
unscrupulous  advisors  with  a  road  map  to  commit  securities  laws  violations  to  the  danger  of 
members and the investing public alike.  PIABA thanks you for the opportunity to comment on 
this important topic.

Re: Request for Comment on Regulatory Notice 25-05 

Dear Ms. Mitchell, 

As  the  Chief  Compliance  Officer  of  a  Registered  Investment  Advisory  (RIA)  firm  having 
registered representatives at a member firm that is independent and not affiliated in any 
manner with my RIA firm, I strongly object to the newly proposed Rule 3290 in Regulatory 
Notice 25-05. 

This  proposed  Rule  would  subject  certain  independent  RIA/IAs  to  an  additional  layer  of 
corporate and regulatory oversight that doesn’t exist for other RIA/IAs that do not have FINRA 
licensure.  Further,  the  proposed  Rule  claims  jurisdiction  over  real  estate,  banking  and 
insurance  businesses,  where  FINRA  has  no  right  to  regulate  under  its  Charter  or  are 
otherwise subject to regulation by other Federal and/or State(s) agencies. 

I have  read  the  Comment  Letter  submitted  by  Mr.  Purcell  of  PKS  Investments,  and  I  fully 
agree  with his stated arguments against promulgating the proposed Rule 3290.  It  will be 
impossible  to  comply  with  client  privacy  mandates,  and  his  citation  of  voluminous 
conflicting  rules  and  guidance  presages  greater  regulatory  confusion  and  turmoil  should 
Rule 3290 be adopted. 

Registered Investment Advisory firms already are regulated by the SEC and the States and 
are not subject to FINRA jurisdiction.  We are fiduciaries and subject to those standards. 
Imposition of FINRA Rules, that are in no way related to our business, on only those RIA firms 
that  have  person(s)  also  registered  with  a  FINRA  member  creates  an  uneven  regulatory 
environment and 
serves no purpose other than an unwarranted expansion of FINRA’s jurisdiction. 

I  strongly  believe  that  the  proposed  Rule  3290  as  currently  written,  together  with  the 
guidance and analysis provided within Regulatory Notice 25-05, should not be adopted.  I

Re: Request  for  Comment  on Regulatory  Notice  25-05

Dear  Ms. Mltchell,

I am  an owner of a Registered lnvestment  Advisory firm  and a registered  representative  of an unaffiliated
FINRA member  firm.  I appreciate  the opportunity  to comment  the  newly  proposed  Rule  3290  as set forth  in
FINRA Regulatory  Notice  25-05.

Fundamental  to the  fiduciary  relationship  that  exists between  our firm and  our clients  is the  trust that our
clients  have  that  their personal information  and  objectives  will  remain  confidential. This  trust,  and the
confidentiality  of the advlsor-client  relationship,  is critical  to our function  as fiduciaries  and  advisors.

Advisor-client  confidentiality,  and  specifically the confidentiality  of client non-public  personal information,  is
protected under federal law and  specifically  Regulation SP. State privacy laws  also  protect the confidential
information  of investment  advisory clients,  in some states more stringently that Regulation SP.

The proposed  Section  3290  provides, at subsection  (d)(4)thereof,  as follows:

For an approved  outside  securities transaction  for  selling compensation,  the  member  shall record
each transaction on the books  and  records ofthe member  and  supervise  the  person's  participation  in
the  transaction as if executed  on behalf  of the member.

Regulatory Notice  25-05 interprets ""outside securities transactions""  to include  securities  orders  placed  by
advisors  on behalf  of their  clients, thus  requiring broker-dealer  supervision  of these transactions  ""as if
executed on behalf of the member.""  Such supervision,  under  the  proposed  rule  a nd its incorporated notices,
would  appear to require  extensive  information  regarding affected advisory clients to be provided  to an
unaffi liated  broker-dealer.

Headquartered at 80 State Stteet, Albany, NY 12207
Purshe Kaplan Sterling Investments and Sterling  Investment  Advisors, Ltd.  are not affiliated

Forcing  an investment  advisor to provide  non-public  personal  information  of an advisory  client  to an
unaffiliated  broker-dealer  violates  the privacy rights  of the advisory client under federal and state  law and
undermines  the confidentiality  that advisory clients  expect and  deserve in their  advisory  relationship.
Providing unaffiliated  broker-dealers  access  to confidential advisory client information  exposes the client's
sensitive financial  information  to parties who are neither entitled  to it nor directly responsible for managing
the client's  assets, thereby violating  the advisor's  ethical  obligations regarding  client confidentiality.

Further,  the proposed  Rule would subject  affected  advisors  to additional oversight  that  doesn't exist for
investment  advisory firms that  do not have  associated persons  with FINRA  licensure. This uneven  layer of
oversight  is unjustified, as there  is no evidence that broker-dealer  oversight  of investment  advisory
transactions  provides  any meaningful  protection  for advisory clients.  Finally,  this additional oversight  is
unsupported  anywhere  in federal  or state  law.

Based  on these  considerations,  I believe that proposed  Rule 3290  as proposed  in Regulatory  Notice  25-05
should  not be adopted.

Thank  you.

Fundamental to the fiduciary relationship that exists between our firm and our clients
is the trust that our clients have that their personal information and objectives will

Advisor-client confidentiality, and specifically the confidentiality of client non-public

the person’s participation in the transaction as if executed on behalf of the member.

Regulatory Notice 25-05 interprets “outside securities transactions” to include
securities orders placed by advisors on behalf of their clients, thus requiring broker-
dealer supervision of these
transactions “as if executed on behalf of the member.” Such supervision, under the
proposed rule and its incorporated notices, would appear to require extensive
information regarding affected advisory clients to be provided to an unaffiliated
broker-dealer.

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Forcing an investment advisor to provide non-public personal information of an
advisory client to an unaffiliated broker-dealer violates the privacy rights of the
advisory client under federal and state law and undermines the confidentiality that
advisory clients expect and deserve in their advisory relationship. Providing
unaffiliated broker-dealers access to confidential advisory client information exposes
the client’s sensitive financial information to parties who are neither entitled to it nor
directly responsible for managing the client’s assets, thereby violating the advisor’s
ethical obligations regarding client confidentiality.

Further, the proposed Rule would subject affected advisors to additional oversight
that doesn’t exist for investment advisory firms that do not have associated persons
with FINRA licensure. This uneven layer of oversight is unjustified, as there is no
evidence that broker-dealer oversight of investment advisory transactions provides
any meaningful protection for advisory clients.
Finally, this additional oversight is unsupported anywhere in federal or state law.

Based on these considerations, I believe that proposed Rule 3290 as proposed in

","For an approved outside securities transaction for selling compensation, the member shall record each transaction on the books and records of the member and supervise the person’s participation in the transaction as if executed on behalf of the member. Regulatory Notice 25-05 interprets “outside securities transactions” to include securities orders placed by advisors on behalf of their clients, thus requiring broker- dealer supervision of these transactions “as if executed on behalf of the member.” Such supervision, under the proposed rule and its incorporated notices, would appear to require extensive information regarding affected advisory clients to be provided to an unaffiliated broker-dealer. Forcing an investment advisor to provide non-public personal information of an advisory client to an unaffiliated broker-dealer violates the privacy rights of the advisory client under federal and state law and undermines the confidentiality that advisory clients expect and deserve in their advisory relationship.",0.9081,0.058,0.041

FINRA 250508 Request to Lighten Regulatory Requirements on Pure Advisory Member Firm
Thursday, May 8, 2025 11:32:37 AM

WARNING: External Sender! Exercise caution with links, attachments and
requests for login information.

To whom it may concern at FINRA,

I am writing on behalf of a FIRNA – registered , NASD member firm, Ferghana
Securities, Inc. Like many small corporate finance-oriented member firms, many of
the FINRA requirements have NO BASIS IN FACT OR INTENT WITH OUR
BUISNESS: we do not have retail or institutional investor customers; we never handle
money; we do not advertise to the public;  we do not write equity research with
investment recommendations; and we do not sell our own investment products or
those of someone else. We are strictly an advisory firm.

We have been beseeching FINRA for years to lighten the paper work and reporting
load on us (and all other similarly situated and constituted firms). Please give an
explicit waiver on all those requirements imposed upon a pure advisory member firm.

Best,
Bill

Regulatory Notice 25-05,Stavis Wealth Transfer Solutions Comment On Regulatory Notice 25-05,2025-05-08,"Dear Ms. Mitchell,
I am the owner of a Registered Investment Advisory firm in Houston, Texas, with five employees and a registered representative of an unaffiliated FINRA member firm.
My position is that rule 3290 in regulatory notice 25–05 would duplicate oversight, and the inefficiency is likely to create unnecessary complexity for RAA’s, unaffiliated Broker Dealers, and most importantly, valued clients.
Client confidentiality is the cornerstone of our business, and their information is protected under federal law, specifically Regulation Capital S P. State privacy laws also protect the confidential information of investment advisory clients.
I have read the proposed rule 3290, and it would appear that there are myriad of conflicting rules and confusion. This is likely to confuse clients and advisors alike, making it difficult for our business to operate and for clients to have clarity and confidence.
As Fiduciaries, we are already subject to the highest standard of conduct. The imposition of overlapping yet unclear FINRA rules creates a burdensome, duplicative regulatory environment and serves no purpose other than expanding FINRA’s jurisdiction.
Also, the proposed rule claims jurisdiction over real estate, which is not clearly defined as private or public, personal or investment property, along with banking and insurance regulation by other federal and or state agencies. This seems dramatically overreaching. Moreover, there is very little clarity about what assets within these asset classes would be included/excluded.
As small business owners, we try to keep our fees low and service high in adhering to the fiduciary standard. Another layer of regulations and is likely to escalate expenses and force us to hire and train more talent.
This is an undue hardship for small businesses that try to keep consumer fees low and service at the Fiduciary Standard.
Having considered the major facets of Rule 3290, I strongly believe that it should not be adopted.
Kind Regards,
Deborah Stavis
