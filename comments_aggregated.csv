Regulatory Notice 25-04,44,0.879,0.098,0.032,"The SEC should eliminate electronic blue sheets and replace it with a system based on CAT data, eliminate the CAT customer and account information system (CAIS) in light of the changes that will discontinue the reporting of PII to the CAT,  and require the SROs to hire an independent party to review and make recommendations on ways to streamline and reduce costs associated with the CAT transactional database, the CAT transaction processing timelines, and the CAT database architecture in the cloud. Amend FAQ items 1.2.1 and 1.7 to permit reliance on the 2232(d)(1) """"functionally separate"""" exception where the principal trading desk that executes the (non-institutional) customer transaction in a given security either: (a) purchased the security from a """"functionally separate"""" principal trading desk within the same member entity (in the case of a customer purchase); or (b) resells the security to a """"functionally separate"""" principal trading desk within the same member entity (in the case of a customer sale); in each case where the latter (non-customer- facing) principal trading desk has no knowledge of the customer transaction. In  March  2001,  FINRA  issued  an Interpretive Letter taking the position that an “offeror may not pay for golf outings, tours or other  forms  of  entertainment  while at a  meeting  it  sponsors  for  the  purpose  of  training  or education.” 16  The  Committee  believes  that  this  interpretive  position  is  overly  broad  and prescriptive, and fails to take into account the numerous existing safeguards that prevent a T&E Meeting from becoming a lavish event, including: (1) limits on the appropriate location for  a  T&E  Meeting;  (2)  the  prohibition  on  reimbursement  of  the  costs  for  guests  of  the associated  person;  (3)  the  limitations  for  paying  for  expenses  incurred  beyond  the  time necessary  for  the  actual  T&E  Meeting;  and  (4)  the  obligation  for  the  training  to  occupy “substantially all of the workday.” As a result of these significant limitations, the Committee believes  that  FINRA  should  adopt  a  principles-based  standard  and/or  issue  guidance recognizing that allowing some type of measured entertainment would not impact the status of a T&E Meeting."
Regulatory Notice 25-05,97,0.301,0.057,0.034,"Under the proposed rule, purchases of private placements continue to require notification and pre-approval even in cases where there is little or no reason regulatory concern about the transaction as in the case where the individual is purchasing the interest on the same basis as other passive investors, e.g., the registered person (1) receives no selling compensation, (2) does not participate in the formation, organization, or management of the entity, (3) does not control the entity, (4) does not sell or promote sales of the entity, and (5) receives only distributions, tax benefits, etc. Exchange Act Section 15(b)(4)(E) provides that the SEC can sanction or revoke the registration of any member firm “if it finds… that such broker or dealer… has willfully aided, abetted, counseled, commanded, induced, or procured the violation by any person of any provision of the Securities Act  of  1933,  the  Investment  Advisers  Act  of  1940,  the  Investment  Company  Act  of  1940,  the Commodity Exchange Act, [the Securities Exchange Act of 1934], the rules or regulations under any  of  such  statutes,  or  the  rules  of  the  Municipal  Securities  Rulemaking  Board,  or  has  failed reasonably to supervise, with a view to preventing violations of the provisions of such statutes, rules, and regulations, another person who commits such a violation, if such other person is subject to his supervision.”  15 U.S.C. In addition, the SEC has stated that  “Regulation  Best  Interest  (“Reg  BI”)  for  broker-dealers  and  the  fiduciary  standard  for investment advisers under the Investment Advisers Act (the “IA fiduciary standard”) are drawn from key fiduciary principles that include an obligation to act in the retail investor’s best interest and not to place their own interests ahead of the investor’s interest.”5  “Both Reg BI and the IA fiduciary standard require your account recommendations to be in the retail investor’s best interest and require you not to place your or your firm’s interests ahead of the retail investor’s interest.” Id."
